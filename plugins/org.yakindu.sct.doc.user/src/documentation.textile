h1(#yakindu-statechart-tools-installation-guide). YAKINDU Statechart Tools Installation Guide

In order to start working with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, you have to install the software on your computer. We are assuming you have downloaded the software package and stored it somewhere on your machine.

h2(#dependencies). Dependencies

h3(#eclipse). Eclipse

YAKINDU Statechart Tools is based on the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) and runs inside Eclipse. The installation process as described below will put a full-fledged Eclipse instance on your computer. It is comprised in the YAKINDU Statechart Tools distribution file you downloaded. You will have to unpack and execute Eclipse in order to work with YAKINDU Statechart Tools inside of it.

h3(#java). Java

While YAKINDU Statechart Tools is based on Eclipse, the latter in turn is based on Java. In order to use Eclipse, you also need a more or less recent Java version on your machine. Depending on what you are going to do with YAKINDU Statechart Tools, you either need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java Development Kit (JDK). Since a JDK always contains a JRE, it is a safe bet to install the former. However, unless you are going to do some Java development – i.&nbsp;e. create a state machine, turn it into Java source code, and use the latter from your Java client code –, you might get away with a JRE. Installation of Java is beyond the scope of this document. You can find more information and download the software from "https://www.java.com/":https://www.java.com/.

In case you don't have Java on your machine yet and you are going to download and install it, make sure you are picking the variant with the correct bit size, i. e. either 32 or 64 bit, whichever is appropriate for your computer.

h2(#platform-overview). Platform overview

You can either install YAKINDU Statechart Tools as a stand-alone software package under the following operating systems.

h2(#installing-on-windows). Installing on Windows

This chapter describes how to install YAKINDU Statechart Tools on a Windows 7 machine.

h3(#unpacking-the-downloaded-file). Unpacking the downloaded file

Unpack the software distribution file. Use the file explorer to open the directory you downloaded the software distribution file to, right-click on the latter, and select _Extract All..._ in the context menu.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_010_eclipse_extract_1.png(Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [1])!

p=. Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows &#91;1]

Choose a directory for YAKINDU Statechart Tools (YAKINDU SCT). The example below assumes you want to install the software in the _C:\Program Files\YAKINDU_ directory.

Depending on your permissions, you might not be able to create a directory and install software under _C:\Program Files_. In this case, please choose another installation directory at a location you are allowed to write to.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_020_eclipse_extract_2.png(Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows [2])!

p=. Unpacking the downloaded file on Windows &#91;2]

Click on _Extract_ to start the extraction process. With Window's built-in unpacker, this will take surprisingly much time. Alternatively, you can use a 3rd-party unpacker like "7-Zip":http://www.7-zip.org/. Saves you a lot of time!

After unpacking, you will find a folder _yakindu-sct_ in your installation directory, i. e. _C:\Program Files\YAKINDU\yakindu-sct_ in our example, as shown in the image below:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_030_eclipse_folder.png(The extracted "yakindu-sct" folder)!

p=. The extracted _yakindu-sct_ folder

The contents of the _yakindu-sct_ folder looks like this:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_040_eclipse_contents.png(Contents of the extracted "yakindu-sct" folder)!

p=. Contents of the extracted _yakindu-sct_ folder

There you are: You have installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools. Now you should start it.

h3(#starting-yakindu-statechart-tools). Starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools

Start YAKINDU Statechart Tools by running the _SCT.exe_ executable.

To do so, please double-click (or single-click, depending on your Windows settings) on the _YAKINDU_ symbol shown in the sample screenshot above.

Depending on the Windows settings and your permissions, you might get the following security warning, indicating that you downloaded the application from a potentially unsecure source:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_045_security_warning.png(Windows security warning)!

p=. Windows security warning

Uncheck the _Always ask before opening this file_ option. Click _Run_ to continue starting the application. Subsequently starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools will not show this security warning again.

While YAKINDU Statechart Tools is starting up, it is showing a splash screen:

p=. YAKINDU Statechart Tools starting up and showing a splash screen

The software needs a _workspace_ directory where it stores its so-called projects along with other data. During the first startup, the _Workspace Launcher_ dialog asks you to specify the workspace directory in the _Workspace_ field. Please select a new and empty one.

In the example below, we chose the _C:\Users\joedoe\workspace_ directory as our workspace. We also checked the _"Use this as the default and do not ask again"_ option. This is sensible, because on subsequent startups, YAKINDU Statechart Tools won't ask for a workspace directory again. Instead it will always use the one we chose once and forever. (You can still change the workspace later via _File → Switch Workspace_ in the main menu.)

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/windows7_install_060_eclipse_workspace_dialog.png(Selecting a workspace)!

p. Please note that YAKINDU Statechart Tools might take some time to catch up with more recent Eclipse releases. The corresponding update repositories will not be available until then.

Instead of an officially stable YAKINDU Statechart Tools _release_, you can alternatively install a _milestone_ build. Since milestone builds are newer than stable releases, they generally have more features available and more bugs fixed. However, they might also contain some new bugs that have gone unnoticed by now.

Enter some text into the _Name_ field. This text is abitrary in principle, but you should choose something that makes it easier for you to identify this particular update repository among other update repositories. In the example below, the repository's name is @YAKINDU Statechart Tools (Luna)@. It describes which piece of software the repository provides (YAKINDU Statechart Tools) and which Eclipse release that software is compatible with (Luna, i. e. Eclipse 4.4).

h2(#five-minutes-tutorial). Five minutes tutorial

This tutorial introduces YAKINDU Statechart Tools (SCT) which provides an integrated modeling environment for the specification and development of reactive, event-driven systems based on the concept of state machines or statecharts. It is an easy-to-use tool featuring sophisticated graphical statechart editing, validation and simulation of statecharts as well as code generation for C, C&#43;&#43;, or Java.

This tutorial you will teach how to

* create a new statechart model, and
* execute it using the simulation engine.

Please note that this tutorial will not explain statecharts in general, so you should familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of state machines first, see "UML state machine":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine.

In order to get a fully-working statechart implementation that you can integrate with your project, you will have to familiarize yourself with _code generation_, which is covered by chapter "Code generation":#code-generation in this documentation. You can generate your state machine implementation as source code in C, C&#43;&#43;, and Java out of the box. Alternatively, you can write your own code generator for other programming languages or for other purposes.

Before we get started, make sure you have YAKINDU Statechart Tools installed. For installation instructions, see the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools Installation Guide":#yakindu-statechart-tools-installation-guide.

h3(#the-light-switch-example). The light switch example

The most basic example of a state machine that actually does something is a light switch. In this scenario there is a light bulb and a switch to turn the bulb on and off. Of course there's also a power source and some electrical cabling to put it all together, but for the purpose of our model we can omit them.

h4(#the-behaviour-of-a-light-switch). The behaviour of a light switch

When modeling the light switch example as a statechart, we can disregard everything (even the bulb) except for the switch. The behaviour of the switch is very simple:

* Initially the light switch is off, i. e. it is in its *Off* state.
* If the light switch is operated while being in its *Off* state, it changes to its *On* state.
* If the light switch is operated while being in its *On* state, it changes to its *Off* state.

h3(#modeling-the-light-switch-as-a-statechart). Modeling the light switch as a statechart

Now let's model the light switch as a statechart using YAKINDU Statechart Tools. This involves the following steps:

# Creating an Eclipse project. It will serve as a container for the statechart model.
# Modeling the light switch using the YAKINDU Statechart Tools editor. The result will be a static statechart model.
# Simulating the model. We can play around with the model, operate the light switch and observe its behaviour.

h4(#creating-an-eclipse-project). Creating an Eclipse project

The first step is to create a new Eclipse project that can serve as a container for our model. From the main menu, select _File → New → Project..._:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_010_menu_file_new_project.png(Selecting "File → New → Project..." in the main menu)!

p=. Selecting "File → New → Project..." in the main menu

The _New Project_ wizard opens, showing a couple of different project types structured in various folders.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_020_wizard_new_project_general_project.png(The "New Project" wizard)!

p=. The "New Project" wizard

Select _General → Project_ and click _Next &gt;_.

The wizard shows its next page:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_040_wizard_new_project.png("Specifying project name and location")!

p=. "Specifying project name and location"

Specify a meaningful _Project name_, e. g. *LightSwitch*, and optionally select a _Location_ to create the project in.

Click _Finish_.

Eclipse creates the new project:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_060_project_created.png(Project "LightSwitch" created)!

p=. Project "LightSwitch" created

h4(#creating-a-folder-for-the-model). Creating a folder for the model

Now that we have created the Eclipse project, we can establish the statechart model of the light switch. It is good practice to use a separate directory for models, so let's create a new folder called _model_.

Right-click on the project's root, i. e. on *LightSwitch*, then select _New → Folder_ from the context menu.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_100_menu_new_folder.png(Selecting "New → Folder" in the context menu)!

p=. Selecting "New → Folder" in the context menu

The _New Folder_ wizard opens:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_110_wizard_new_folder.png(The "New Folder" wizard)!

p=. The "New Folder" wizard

Give the model folder a reasonable name, e. g. *model*, and type it into the _Folder Name_ text field. Then click _Finish_.

The new _model_ folder is created and appears in the _Project Explorer_ view at the left.

h4(#starting-with-an-empty-statechart-model). Starting with an empty statechart model

h5(#using-the-yakindu-statechart-wizard). Using the YAKINDU Statechart wizard

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_140_wizard_new_yakindu_statechart.png(The "New YAKINDU Statechart" dialog)!

p=. The "New YAKINDU Statechart" dialog

The dialog asks you for the project, the directory, and the name of the model file to be created. Eclipse project and directory should be preset correctly already. In our case the corresponding text field contains *LightSwitch/model* which means the directory named *model* in the *LightSwitch* project. You can change that if you wish, but most likely you won't.

The default file name in the _File Name_ field is *default.sct*, however. You should change that to something more meaningful. In our case we type *LightSwitch.sct* into the _File name_ field, see the screenshot above.

Click _Finish_.

Since there's a dedicated perspective for statechart models, Eclipse asks you whether you want to change to it now or not:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_150_dialog_confirm_perspective_switch.png(Dialog "Confirm Perspective Switch")!

p=. Dialog "Confirm Perspective Switch"

Please answer the question regarding switching to the _YAKINDU Modeling_ perspective by clicking on the _Yes_ button. The _YAKINDU Modeling_ perspective has a graphical editor for statechart models, and you will need it to create and modify statecharts. On the other hand your answer really doesn't matter that much, because you can switch perspectives at any time. If you check _Do not offer to switch perspective in the future_ before clicking _Yes_, Eclipse will never ask this question again, at least regarding the _YAKINDU Modeling_ perspective.

bq. *Please note:* If the _Confirm Perspective Switch_ dialog does not appear as described above you probably have already confirmed _Do not offer to switch perspective in the future_ once before.

h5(#the-initial-model). The initial model

An empty statechart is created and displayed in the *statechart editor* in the middle of the Eclipse workbench. In the screenshot below the statechart editor is marked by a red rectangle. Subsequently, we will use the statechart editor to graphically develop the light switch statechart.

p(#light_switch_220_statechart_editor). 
!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_220_statechart_editor.png(The statechart editor)!

p=. The statechart editor

Actually the new statechart isn't really empty. It already contains the initial state (a small filled black circle), a "normal" state, and a transition leading from the former to the latter.

h4(#statechart-validation). Statechart validation

h5(#error-markers-in-the-model-graph). Error markers in the model graph

The "normal" state, however, has a small filled red circle containing a white ‘X' attached. This is an error marker and tells you that something is wrong with your model, particularly with the object it is attached to.

###. FIXME: Bring documentation up to date!

bq. *Please note:* Since the current version of the statechart editor gives that state a proper name ("StateA"), the error marker is no longer present in a new model. So the following description is somewhat out of date. This will be fixed in a future version of this documentation. Until then, please follow the subsequent text nevertheless, because you will learn something important about statechart validation.

h5(#error-markers-in-the-project-explorer). Error markers in the project explorer

The error marker is also shown in the _Project Explorer_ view at the left-hand side of the main window. In this way you can see immediately which of your projects contain errors. Click on the small show/hide symbol (triangle) left of a project's or any other resource's name to show or hide its respective contents. By doing so, you can quickly encircle the directories and files that are affected by errors. In the screenshot above we have clicked open the _LightSwitch_ project and the _model_ directory, showing the error is in the _LightSwitch.sct_ file.

h5(#validation-principles). Validation principles

This error marker exemplifies YAKINDU Statechart Tools' model validation capabilities. Statechart validation includes syntactical and semantical checks of the whole statechart. For example, a statechart is checked for unreachable states, dead ends, or references to unknown events. These validation constraints are checked during editing. In case any constraints are violated, error or warning markers are attached to the faulty model elements. Thus the user receives direct and immediate feedback on the validation state of his statechart.

Hovering with the mouse over the error marker in the statechart editor reveals what the problem is. A small popup appears and displays the error description: "A state must have a name."

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_210_error_marker_and_popup.png(An error marker and a popup window explaining it)!

p=. An error marker and a popup window explaining it

h5(#error-markers-in-the-problems-view). Error markers in the "problems" view

An alternative place to see error messages is the _Problems_ view. This view has the particular advantage to comprise all notifications in a clearly arranged list form, see the "screenshot above":#light_switch_220_statechart_editor. It displays:

* A summary comprising the total number of errors, warnings, and others. In our case we have one error and nothing else.
* Zero or more lists containing errors, warnings, and other types of messages, if available. In our example there is a just a single list containing error messages. Click on the show/hide symbol to show the message list's contents or the list's header only.

Double-clicking on an error message in the _Problems_ view brings you directly to the erroneous object.

Hang on, we will correct the error in a second!

h4(#giving-a-state-a-name). Giving a state a name

As we have seen, the initial statechart is erroneous insofar as the state does not have a name. So let's fix that.

Remember the requirements of our light switch example? The first requirement demands the switch to be off initially. The erroneous state is reached from the initial state immediately, so it is appropriate to name it *Off*.

table(scedit).
|<. Double-click on the string @<name>@ in the state object. The string turns into a text input field with @<name>@ being highlighted:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_01.png!|
|<. Type the state's new name, i. e. @Off@:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_02.png!|
|<. Hit the @[Enter]@ key or click anywhere outside the text field. Bingo! The state now has a proper name and the error marker disappears:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_03.png!|
|<. However, since the state box's size is smaller than before now while the box's left position remains unchanged, the graph looks crooked.|<. |
|<. We can improve it by dragging the state box a little bit to the right. When it is centered below the initial state symbol, a vertical blue line appears giving the user a visual hint:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_04.png!|
|<. Drop the state box at this very place, and everything looks much better now:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_05.png!|
|<. Alternatively, we could have used the state box's handles to resize it. However, we just deselect the box by clicking elsewhere:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_230_statechart_editor_change_state_name_06.png!|

h4(#creating-a-state). Creating a state

With the *Off* state only, the light switch statechart isn't complete yet. We also need an *On* state, and we going to create it now.

table(scedit).
|<. In order to add another state, move the mouse pointer to the _Palette_ compartment at the right-hand side of the statechart editor. Click on the _State_ symbol in the palette without releasing the mouse button, and drag the symbol over to the editing area.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_240_statechart_editor_create_state_01.png!|
|<. Release the mouse button over a gray area, a region:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_240_statechart_editor_create_state_02.png!|

|<. You'll notice that the new state is showing an error marker. The reason is that it is not yet possible to reach the *On* state.|<. |
|<. Before we'll go on and fix that problem, here's another way to create a new state. When you are hovering with the mouse pointer over the main region, i. e. the large rectangle with a gray background, a popup menu shows up. If you click on the ‘S' symbol in that menu, a new state will be created. Other options in this menu are to create an initial state, a final state, or a choice.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_240_statechart_editor_create_state_05.png!|

h4(#creating-a-transition). Creating a transition

As we have seen above, the *On* state is not reachable as of yet. So let's model switching the light switch from "off" to "on" as a transition leading from the *Off* state to the *On* state.

table(scedit).
|<. In the _Palette_, click on the _Transition_ symbol. The symbol's background turns blue.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_250_statechart_editor_create_transition_01.png!|
|<. Click on the *Off* state, but don't release the mouse button. Drag the mouse pointer towards the *On* state. The arrow representing the transition to be established is drawn.:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_250_statechart_editor_create_transition_02.png!|
|<. Once the mouse pointer reaches the target state, it changes its shape:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_250_statechart_editor_create_transition_03.png!|
|<. Releasing the mouse button establishes the transition. A text input field to specify event trigger, guard condition and effect appears. We want the transition to be triggered when the light switch is operated, so let's type @operate@ into the text field.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_250_statechart_editor_create_transition_04.png!|
|<. If you suspect that something is not in order, because the input text is underlined in red, you are right. We will explain and deal with that in a minute.|<. |
|<. Clicking anywhere outside the text field terminates the editing mode:|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_250_statechart_editor_create_transition_05.png!|

The event trigger _operate_ is flagged as an error. The reason is that an event with that name is not known yet. The screenshot below shows how to change that:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_260_statechart_editor_create_definitions_01.png(Creating definitions [1])!

p=. Creating definitions &#91;1]

Double-click into the *definition section* on the left-hand side of the statechart editor. The section becomes an editable text field.

Enter the following text:

bc. internal:
    event operate


The keyword @internal@ makes the following definition of the _operate_ event belong to the internal scope. The latter is explained in section "&quot;Internal scope&quot;":#internal-scope.

Click anywhere outside of the text field, which terminates editing the definition section. The statechart editor digests the definition, recognizes the definition of the _operate_ event, and validates the model as being okay:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_260_statechart_editor_create_definitions_02.png(Creating definitions [2])!

p=. Creating definitions &#91;2]

In its current state the model would not allow to turn the light switch off again, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. Operating the light switch while it is on should turn it off again. Let's model this by adding another transition. It should lead from the source state *On* to the target state *Off*.

table(scedit).
|<. However, in order to not get two straight lines being close together in the graph, let's first make some room and turn the present line into an arc. Move the mouse pointer over the transition line, but not over the text. The mouse pointer changes its shape to indicate that you can insert a control point. Click and hold to add the control point, then drag it to an appropriate position.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_270_statechart_editor_create_transition_01.png!|
|<. Now let's insert the second transition. This time we won't use the palette, but instead use another method. Hover the mouse pointer over the source state, i. e. *On*. An incoming and an outgoing arrow appear, both with a handle. Click and hold the handle of the outgoing arrow and drag it to the *Off* target state.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_270_statechart_editor_create_transition_02.png!|
|<. Upon releasing the mouse button the transition is established. Type @operate@ as the transition's event trigger into the text field. Reshape the transition arrow to make the graph look nice.|<. !{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_270_statechart_editor_create_transition_03.png!|

h3(#simulating-the-light-switch-model). Simulating the light switch model

Simulating a model means to execute it, raise events manually, have time events and run cycle-based events being triggered automatically, and observe its behaviour.

Start the simulation by right-clicking on the _LightSwitch.sct_ file in the project explorer and selecting _Run As → Statechart Simulation_:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_300_statechart_simulator_run_as_statechart_simulation.png(Selecting "Run As → Statechart Simulation" in the context menu)!

p=. Selecting "Run As → Statechart Simulation" in the context menu

The perspective changes from _SC Modeling_ to _SC Simulation_. This perspective defines two additional views:

* The _Debug_ view at the top shows all running statechart instances and allows to select one of them. YAKINDU Statechart Tools allow multiple executions of the same statechart as well as parallel executions of different statecharts at the same time.
* The _Simulation_ view on the right-hand side is used to raise events and to inspect and modify variables. Depending on your screen resolution and font size settings, you might not be able to spot the _Simulation_ view by its name, because the tab containing it is quite narrow and might not provide enough space for displaying the title. Hover over the tabs to reveal their respective titles in a popup window. Figure "&quot;Light switch simulation in &quot;off&quot; state&quot;":#fig_light_switch_simulation_in_off_state is demonstrating this: The user has hovered the mouse pointer over a tab that is just displaying the starting letter 'S' of its title. However, a popup window right besides the pointer is showing the tab's full title "Simulation View".

Not surprisingly, the simulation starts at the initial state and then transitions to the *Off* state immediately. The latter becomes the active state now. It is highlighted by a red background:

p(#fig_light_switch_simulation_in_off_state). 

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_310_statechart_simulator_state_off.png(Light switch simulation in "off" state)!

p=. Light switch simulation in "off" state

Now that the light switch is off, let's turn the lights on by operating the switch. In the simulation, we will have to raise the _operate_ event. How can we do this?

In the _Simulation_ view at the right-hand side of the Eclipse workbench, click on the _internal_ entry's show/hide symbol to display its contents.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_320_statechart_simulator_state_events.png(Displaying event names in the statechart simulator's _Simulation_ view)!

p=. Displaying event names in the statechart simulator's _Simulation_ view

The _operate_ event is shown. Click on it to raise the event, i. e. to operate the light switch.

The transition arc leading from the *Off* state to the *On* state flashes briefly in red, and then the *On* state becomes active. Its background color changes to red while the *Off* state's background color becomes normal again.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/light_switch_330_statechart_simulator_state_on.png(Light switch simulation in "on" state)!

p=. Light switch simulation in "on" state

Click on _operate_ again, and the active state changes back to *Off*. Click on _operate_ several times and enjoy watching the state machine's behaviour.

Stop the simulator by clicking at the little red termination button in the toolbar at the top.

h3(#code-generation). Code generation

YAKINDU Statechart Tools include code generators for Java, C, and C&#43;&#43; out of the box. The code generators are following a "code-only" approach: They are generating all the code that is needed and do not rely on any additional runtime libraries. The generated code provides a well-defined application programming interface and can be integrated easily with any client code. In this tutorial we will generate Java code for a sample statechart modeling the handling of a phone call, the *CallHandling* example.

h4(#the-callhandling-example). The CallHandling example

The state machine handling a phone call works as follows:

* After startup, the system is in an idle state and is waiting for incoming calls.
* When a call comes in, the user can either accept the call or dismiss it.
* If the users accepts the call and opens a connection, the system is tracking the duration of the call and is waiting for the user to hang up.
* After hanging up, the system displays the total time of call and then returns to its idle state.

The complete statechart model is shown below:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_model.png(The CallHandling statechart model)!

p=. The CallHandling statechart model

In order to eventually obtain the *CallHandling* example in the form of executable code, we have to create the model in the statechart editor first, followed by creating a suitable generator model, followed by executing the code generator to create the source code we need.

h4(#creating-the-statechart-model). Creating the statechart model

"Above":#starting-with-an-empty-statechart-model tutorial we have seen how to work with the statechart editor. So let's create a new project now and use the statechart editor to create the *CallHandling* statechart model as outlined above.

Since we are going to generate Java code, we should use a Java project to host the statechart model. Use _File → New → Java Project_ and follow the _New Java Project_ wizard to create one.

In addition to what we have learned above already, there is one new concept: interfaces.

h5(#creating-interfaces). Creating interfaces

Statecharts can describe very complex interactions between a multitude of actors and an even bigger multitude of events these actors can receive or trigger. It is therefore good practice to structure such events and associate them with their respective actors. For this purpose YAKINDU Statecharts Tools provides the concept of so-called _interfaces_.

In the _CallHandling_ example, we have two actors: the user and the phone. Let's model their communication as two interfaces:

* The _Phone_ interface provides a single incoming event named _incoming&#95;call_.
* The _User_ interface comprises two incoming events: _accept&#95;call_ and _dismiss&#95;call_.

We have to enter the respective definitions in textual form into the statechart editor. Here's how the interface definitions look like:

bc.. interface User:
    in event accept_call
    in event dismiss_call

interface Phone:
    var duration : integer
    in event incoming_call

p. As you can see, the _Phone_ interface also has an integer variable _duration_ which will track the duration of the call. The interface definitions above have to go into the statechart editor's definition block on the left-hand side of the statechart editor.

If everything went well, any error markers in the model are gone. Your model should look like the one in the screenshot below:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_example_final.png(The CallHandling statechart modeled in the statechart editor)!

p=. The CallHandling statechart modeled in the statechart editor

h4(#creating-a-generator-model). Creating a generator model

For code generation, YAKINDU Statechart Tools use a textual generator model called *SGen*. The generator model holds key parameters for the code generation process and allows for the latter's customization.

The first step to code generation is to create a new SGen model. Right-click on the _model_ folder in the project explorer and select _New → Code Generator Model_ from the context menu.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_200_generation_create_generator_model.png(Selecting "New → Code Generator Model" in the context menu)!

p=. Selecting "New → Code Generator Model" in the context menu

The _YAKINDU Generator Model_ wizard opens. Change the _File name_ to *CallHandling.sgen*, then click _Next &gt;_.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_210_generation_new_sgen_model_1.png(Selecting a filename for the generator model)!

p=. Selecting a filename for the generator model

From the _Generator_ drop-down menu at the top, select _YAKINDU SCT Java Code Generator_.

In the statechart tree beneath that menu, check the *CallHandling.sct* model, then click _Finish_.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_220_generation_new_sgen_model_2.png(Selecting generator type and statechart model)!

p=. Selecting generator type and statechart model

Now the wizard creates the default SGen model for Java code generation and opens it in an SGen editor. The project explorer on the left-hand side shows the new model file _CallHandling.sgen_.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_230_generation_new_sgen_model_3.png(The generator model)!

p=. The generator model

Here's the generator model once again as plain text:

bc.. 
GeneratorModel for yakindu::java {

    statechart CallHandling {

        feature Outlet {
            targetProject = "CallHandling"
            targetFolder = "src-gen"
            libraryTargetFolder = "src"
        }
    }
}

p. Let's have a closer look at the listing above:

* @yakindu::java@ is the unique ID of the Java code generator.
* The @statechart CallHandling { … }@ block references the statechart model we want to generate code for.
* The @feature Outlet { … }@ block specifies where the generated code artifacts are to be placed:
** The parameters @targetProject@ and @targetFolder@ define the Eclipse project @CallHandling@ as destination for generated code and within that project the @src-gen@ folder.
** However, certain source code modules are generated only once and won't change with the underlying statechart. By default, these source code artifacts are generated into the folder specified by the @libraryTargetFolder@ option which by default is @src@. You can change the folder name or even remove the @libraryTargetFolder@ option at all. In the latter case the "library" components are generated into the @targetFolder@.

A statechart reference may contain various configuration features. You will learn more about them later.

###. FIXME: Insert a reference here.

h4(#enhancing-the-generator-model-by-timing-capabilities). Enhancing the generator model by timing capabilities

The default generator model is insufficient yet. The _CallHandling_ statechart model uses _after_ and _every_ expressions. That is, it is dealing with *time events*, requiring a timer service to trigger them. We can instruct the code generator to provide us with a default timer service implementation by adding the following feature to the generator model:

bc. feature GeneralFeatures {
    TimerService = true
}


h4(#generating-java-source-code). Generating Java source code

What do we have to do to actually start the Java source code generation? Nothing!

The generator model is executed by a so-called Eclipse _builder_. That is, as long as the _Project → Build Automatically_ menu item is checked (which it is by default), the artifacts are generated automatically with each modification of the statechart model or of the generator model.

As you can see in the project explorer, the folder _src-gen_ has been created and populated with the generated Java source code artifacts.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_240_generation_timer_service.png(Adding the timer service feature)!

p=. Adding the timer service feature

Add the generated artifacts to the Java build path by right-clicking on the _src-gen_ folder and selecting _Build Path → Use as source folder_ in the context menu.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_250_generation_use_as_source_folder.png(Declaring "src-gen" as a source folder)!

p=. Declaring "src-gen" as a source folder

If you want to execute your generator model manually, select _Generate Code Artifacts_ from the @.sgen@ file's context menu in the project explorer.

h4(#integration-with-client-code). Integration with client code

Now that we have a generated Java implementation of the _CallHandling_ state machine available, we want to actually use it from some client code. We'll create that client code in a second.

h5(#creating-client-code). Creating client code

Let's establish a new Java class _CallHandlingClient_ and integrate the state machine with it:

# Right-click on the _src_ folder.
# Select _New → Class_ in the context menu.
# Name it _CallHandlingClient_.<br/>!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/callhandling_300_java_integration_create_new_class.png!
# Click _Finish_.

Next, copy the following code into the created class:

bc.. 
  import org.yakindu.scr.TimerService;
  import org.yakindu.scr.callhandling.CallHandlingStatemachine;

  public class CallHandlingClient {

      public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

          // Create the state machine:
          CallHandlingStatemachine sm = new CallHandlingStatemachine();
          sm.setTimer(new TimerService());

          // Initialize the state machine:
          sm.init();

          // Enter the state machine and implicitly activate its "Idle" state:
          sm.enter();

          // Raise an incoming call:
          sm.getSCIPhone().raiseIncoming_call();
          sm.runCycle();

          // Accept the call:
          sm.getSCIUser().raiseAccept_call();
          sm.runCycle();

          // Keep the phone conversation busy for a while:
          for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
              Thread.sleep(200);
              sm.runCycle();
          }

          // Before hang-up, output the duration of the call:
          System.out.println(String.format("The phone call took %d seconds.",
                  sm.getSCIPhone().getDuration()));

          // Hang up the phone:
          sm.getSCIUser().raiseDismiss_call();
          sm.runCycle();
      }
  }

p. Let's have a detailed look at this client code:

* First, this program creates a new instance of the state machine by calling the default @CallHandlingStatemachine@ constructor:
** @CallHandlingStatemachine sm = new CallHandlingStatemachine();@
* Since we are using time events, the statechart implementation requires an implementation of the @ITimer@ interface. And since we added the @TimerService@ feature to the generator model, the code generator creates a default implementation @org.yakindu.scr.TimerService@ that uses the @java.util.Timer@ class. A new instance of the default @TimerService@ is created and set to the state machine:
** @sm.setTimer(new TimerService());@
* The state machine and its internal data structures are initialized:
** @sm.init();@
* After that, @sm.enter()@ enters the state machine and – via its initial state – activates its *Idle* state.
* For each interface in the statechart definition block a getter method has been generated, here @getSCIPhone()@ and @getSCIUser()@. You can access all incoming events and all variables via these interfaces.
** @sm.getSCIPhone().raiseIncoming_call();@ raises the _incoming&#95;call_ event, activating the *Incoming Call* state after the next run cycle has been executed. The latter is triggered by @sm.runCycle()@.
* @sm.getSCIUser().raiseAccept_call()@ accepts the call or, to be more precise, raises the _accept_call_ event via the _User_ interface. It activates the *Active Call* state after the next run cycle has been performed by @sm.runCycle();@.
* In the @for@ loop, the run cycle is executed periodically every 200 milliseconds. This simulates the duration of the phone call.
* Before hanging up the phone, let's find out how much time we spent in the call. @sm.getSCIPhone().getDuration()@ retrieves the call's duration, which is then formatted and printed to the console.
* Finally, @sm.getSCIUser().raiseDismiss_call()@ raises the _dismiss_call_ event. It activates the *Dismiss Call* state after the next run cycle.

h2(#the-statechart-language). The statechart language

This chapter describes the statechart elements of the YAKINDU Statechart Tools (YAKINDU SCT) editor. The YAKINDU SCT meta model is the model of finite state machines. It is based on the view of a system that is defined by a finite number of states. The behavior of such a system is based on its active states. These states are determined by the history of the state machine. Very important are the theoretical models for state machines by Mealy and Moore. Mealy state machines associate actions with transitions. Moore machines associate actions with states (_entry_, _exit_). YAKINDU SCT can model both these types.

The YAKINDU SCT meta model is designed similar to the UML statechart meta model with the following differences:

* YAKINDU SCT statecharts are self-contained with interfaces defined by events and variables.
* Core execution semantics are run cycle-driven, not event-driven.
** This allows to process concurrent events.
** Event-driven behavior can be defined on top.
* Time is an abstract concept for statecharts.
* Time control is delegated to the environment.

The model interpreter and different flavors of generated code are following these same core semantics.

Please refer to the Wikipedia article "UML state machine":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine for more details.

A textual description language is used to declare and describe behaviors in a state machine. It is case sensitive.

TBD

h3(#graphical-elements). Graphical elements

h4(#region). Region

As already mentioned, the YAKINDU statecharts are self-contained. They are organized in regions. Due to this it is possible to organize multiple state machines in different regions and to run them concurrently.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/parallelRegions.jpg(Parallel regions)!

p=. Parallel regions

h4(#state). State

States are the central elements of a state machine. A state has to be placed inside a region and must have a name that is unique inside this region. During simulation, each state can be active or passive. An active state has actions that are accomplished. Either an action is carried out on entering a state, during active state, or on exit.

h4(#transition). Transition

A transition is the transfer of one state to another. Transitions are diagrammed as arrows. They can have events and actions, but don't need to.

The syntax of events and actions is defined by a "textual description language":#the-statechart-language. Please refer to section "Events":#events of this documentation for more details! For more details on actions please see chapter "Actions":#reaction-triggers.

If a state has more than a single outgoing transition without event, then among those transitions the one that has been modeled first will be carried out.

h4(#entry). Entry

When a state machine starts or when the control flow enters a "region":#region, an _entry_ defines which state is to be activated first. The flow passes through the state machine's or the region's entry and transitions to the target state the entry's transition is pointing to. This state becomes active.

An entry has a single outgoing transistion and no incoming ones. Its outgoing transition has neither a trigger nor a guard condition.

An entry is depicted as a filled circle, see "figure &quot;Entry, exit, and final state&quot;":#fig_state_entry_exit_final_explained.

p(#fig_state_entry_exit_final_explained). 
!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/state_entry_exit_final_explained.png(Entry, exit, and final state)!

p=. Entry, exit, and final state

h5(#default-entry). Default entry and initial state

An entry without a name is called the _default entry_. It is similar to the UML's _initial state_. However, while the transition from the initial state to an ordinary state may specify a guard, the transition sourced at an entry cannot.

A region may have at most one default entry.

h5(#named-entries). Named entries

The "default entry":#default-entry specifies a single entry point into a region. A region can provide a multitude of additional or alternative entry points, thus implementing different kinds of behaviour, depending on which entry point has been taken. If a region comprises multiple entries, these entries must be _named_. An entry's name must be unique within its region.

The default entry implicitly has the name @default@. Alternatively, it is possible to explicitly give the name @default@ to the default entry. Semantically both variants are equivalent. Whether an entry has no name or it has the name @default@: in both cases the entry is called _default entry_.

An incoming transition specifies a named entry to be used by the entry's _name_. This is done in a so-called _transition property_ of the transition, according to the following format:

@# >@ _entry-name_

Named entries have no equivalent in the UML.

The sample statechart in "Figure &quot;Entry state&quot;":#fig_state_entry has a composite state named _Handle result_. This composite state has a default entry as well as an entry called _failure_. If state _A_ is active and the _error_ trigger fires, control is transitioned to the _Handle result_ composite state. The notation @error # >failure@ specifies that the _failure_ entry is to be used.

p(#fig_state_entry). 
!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/state_entry.png(Entry state)!

p=. Entry state

h4(#exit). Exit

An _exit_ is a pseudo state that is used to leave and deactivate a composite state. Exits are counterpart to "entries":#entry. They are also known as exit points, exit states, or exit nodes. See "section &quot;Final state&quot;":#final for a different way to terminate a region or state machine.

An exit may have multiple incoming transistions and has no outgoing one.

An exit state is depicted as an unfilled circle with an X-shaped cross, see "figure &quot;Entry, exit, and final state&quot;":#fig_state_entry_exit_final_explained.

Within a region, multiple exits are allowed. Each exit must either have a name that is unique within its region or be the _default exit_. The default exit is either unnamed or has the name @default@, which is semantically equivalent. A region may have at most one default exit.

When a composite state reaches an exit in any of its regions, all states in other regions of that composite state, if any, are deactivated immediately. The composite state will be left and be deactivated. It maintains no status information that could be probed from the outside. In other words, reaching an exit in one of a composite state's regions has severe consequences for all the other regions since they are exited and disposed immediately. After that, the containing composite state is also exited. There must be an unguarded transition that catches the exit and leads to another state outside of the composite state. The semantics of exit is different from that of final state; please see "section &quot;Final state&quot;":#final for details.

A transition that has a composite state as its source can specify which exits should triggered it. That is, different exits can lead to different behavior on the outside. A transition specifies the exits to react upon as a so-called _property_ which looks like this:

@#@ _exit-point-1_@<@ [ _exit-point-2_ @<@ ]…

Exits have no equivalent in the UML.

The sample statechart in "figure &quot;Entries and exits&quot;":#fig_state_entry_exit contains two composite states:

* The composite state _Process_ models a process with two passes (states) A and B. If both passes succeed, the composite state is left via the _no&#95;problem_ exit node. However, if an error occurs in either A or B the execution flow proceeds to the _problem_ exit point and leaves the composite state there.
* The composite state _Handle result_ is intended to handle the processing result, be it success or failure. It has two entry points _success_ and _failure_.

The question is how to connect the exit points of _Process_ to the corresponding entry points of _Handle result_. This is done by two transitions leading from _Process_ to _Handle result_ and appropriate specifications.

The transition shown on the left specifies @# no_problem> >success@. This means: If the source composite state is left via the _no&#95;problem_ exit point, enter the target composite state at the _success_ entry point. The specification of the transition on the right is analogous: If the source state is left via the _problem_ exit point, enter the target state at the _failure_ entry point.

The order of exit and entry points in a transition specification is irrelevant. Instead, the position of the @>@ character is decisive:

* If the @>@ character is to the _right_ of a name, like in @exit_name>@, that name denotes an _exit_.
* If the @>@ character is to the _left_ of a name, like in @>entry_name@, that name denotes an _entry_.

Alternatively, _Process_ could have been modeled with two different error exit states, say _error&#95;1_ and _error&#95;2_. This would allow to respond differently to different error conditions, while still enabling to catch them both with a single flow. A transition with @# >error_1 >error_2 problem>@ would do so.

p(#fig_state_entry_exit). 
!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/state_entry_exit.png(Entries and exits)!

p=. Entries and exits

h4(#final). Final state

A _final state_ denotes the end of the execution flow of a state machine or region. See "section &quot;Exit state&quot;":#exit for a different way to terminate a composite state.

A final state is depicted as an unfilled circle with a smaller filled black circle inside, see "figure &quot;Entry, exit, and final state&quot;":#fig_state_entry_exit_final_explained.

A final state can have multiple incoming transitions and has no outgoing ones.

Within a region, only a single final state is allowed, but each region may have its own final state.

When a region reaches its final state, control stops there and waits until all other orthogonal regions, if any, have reached their respective final states, too. The semantics of final states is different from that of exits; please see "section &quot;Exit state&quot;":#exit for details.

bq.. *Note*

Final states are proper states. This is different from the UML, where a final state is a pseudo state, i. e. in the UML, it cannot have any properties normal states can have, except for a name.


h4(#choice). Choice

A choice is a pseudo state. It can be used to model a conditional path. A choice node divides a transition into multiple parts.

Usually the first transition points towards the choice node. One of the choice's outgoing transitions can carry a condition.

h4(#synchronization). Synchronization

Synchronization is a means to either split a flow into several parallel regions of a substate or to join several parallel flows from orthogonal regions into a single flow. The synchronization state corresponds to the UML's concepts of fork and join.

Whether a synchronization state behaves as a fork or as a join depends on its usage.

* A synchronization with a single incoming transition and several outgoing ones _forks_ the flow into several regions of the same substate. These regions are executed in parallel, see "section &quot;Orthogonal states&quot;":#orthogonal-states.
* A synchronization with several incoming transitions from parallel regions of the same substate and a single outgoing transition _joins_ the incoming flows into a single flow of execution.

A synchronization state is shown as a thick horizontal or vertical line, as can be seen in figure "Synchronization state":#fig_state_synchronization.

p(#fig_state_synchronization). 

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/state_synchronization.png(Synchronization state)!

p=. Synchronization state

For a synchronization to actually join the incoming transitions and execute the outgoing one, all of the following conditions must be met:

* All source states must be active.
* All guard conditions that are specified must be fulfilled.
* If one or more triggers are defined, at least one trigger must fire at a point in time while the conditions above are met.

"Synchronization state":#fig_state_synchronization shows an sample statechart containing a forking and a joining synchronization. After having left the @Initialize@ state, the synchronization state forks the execution flow into two regions @r1@ and @r2@. Both are part of the @Process@ composite state and both are executed in parallel. That is, when activating @Process@, the substates @Line A 1@ and @Line B 1@ also become active. When the flows continues and both @Line A 2@ and @Line B 2@ have been reached, the synchronization state on the right-hand side joins the flows and transitions to substates @Cleanup@, making it the active state. However, as long as only one of them is active, the synchronization will wait for the other one to also become active before proceeding to @Process@.

The example also demonstrates different lengths and orientations of the synchronization symbol. In the statechart editor, first select the synchronization symbol, the use a handle in one of the symbol's corners to change length or orientation. The handles in the middle of the symbol have no effect.

h4(#composite-state). Composite state

A composite state is a state comprising one or more state machines. These state machines are also organized in regions within the composite state.

Besides the simple composite state YAKINDU SCT knows about two kinds of composite states: orthogonal states and submachine states.

Composite states contain other state machine branches.

h4(#orthogonal-states). Orthogonal states

In the context of state machines orthogonal states are states that are independent of each other. The presumably most famous example is the keyboard example:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/orthogonalState_example.jpg(Orthogonal states)!

p=. Orthogonal states

h4(#shallow-history). Shallow history

The shallow history state is a pseudo state that is placed inside regions of composite states. It is used to remember the last active state inside a composite state. This makes it possible to jump back to the remembered state instead of starting at the inner initial state again.

The following example, showing the answering of a questionaire, explains this:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/shallowHistory01.jpg(Shallow history [1])!

p=. Shallow history &#91;1]

Particularly interesting in this statechart are the events @checkProgress@ and @goon@. The event @checkProgress@ jumps back to the @init@ state while assigning the current progress count to the variable @temp@. The event @goon@ jumps to the shallow history state that was placed inside the composite state.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/shallowHistory02.jpg(Shallow history [2])!

p=. Shallow history &#91;2]

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/shallowHistory03.jpg(Shallow history [3])!

p=. Shallow history &#91;3]

When the @goon@ event is triggered, the most recent active state inside of the composite state @answeringQuestions@ is activated again.

h4(#deep-history). Deep history

Deep history is similar to shallow history, but more complex. With a deep history the latest state of multiple nested states is remembered.

h3(#types). Types

The language has a small integrated type system consisting of the following simple types:

* integer
* real
* boolean
* string
* void

h4(#declaring-variables). Declaring variables

Variables are typed. A variable is declared specifying its type:

bc. var intVar : integer
var realVar : real
var boolVar : boolean
var stringVar : string


h4(#declaring-events). Declaring events

Events are typed. An event is declared specifying its type:

bc. event addInt : integer
event addReal : real
event checkValidity : boolean
event stringEvent : string
event voidEvent : void


h3(#statements). Statements

A statement is one of three kinds:

* assignment
* event raising
* operation call

h4(#assignments). Assignments

The language has the following assignment operators:

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left">simple assignment</td><td align="left">@=@</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">multiply and assign</td><td align="left">@*=@</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">divide and assign</td><td align="left">@/=@</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">calculate modulo and assign</td><td align="left">@%=@</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">add and assign</td><td align="left">@+=@</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">subtract and assign</td><td align="left">@-=@</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">bitshift left and assign</td><td align="left">@<<=@</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">bitshift right and assign</td><td align="left">@>>=@</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">bitwise AND and assign</td><td align="left">@&=@</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">bitwise XOR and assign</td><td align="left">@^=@</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">bitwise OR and assign</td><td align="left">@|=@</td></tr></tbody></table>

h4(#raising-an-event). Raising an event

An event is raised by calling a method whose name consists of the word @raise@, immediately followed by the event name, e. g. @raiseIncoming_call()@. If the event is an interface event, the name of the interface must also be appended.

###. FIXME: Add an example!

h4(#calling-an-operation). Calling an operation

An operation is called similar to other programming languages with the operation name and passing concrete parameters. The parameters can be expressions.

###. FIXME: Add an example!

h3(#expressions). Expressions

Expressions in YAKINDU Statechart Tools are similar to expressions in other programming languages. The language provides operators for logical expressions, number arithmetic, bitwise arithmetic, and bit shifting.

The type of a logical expression is *boolean*.

h4(#LogicalAND). Logical AND

bc. expr1 && expr2


h4(#LogicalOR). Logical OR

bc. expr1 ||  expr2


h4(#LogicalNOT). Logical NOT

bc. !expr1


h4(#Conditionalexpression). Conditional expression

bc. expr1 ? expr2 : expr3


h4(#BitwiseXOR). Bitwise XOR

bc. expr1 ^ expr2


h4(#BitwiseOR). Bitwise OR

bc. expr1 | expr2


h4(#BitwiseAND). Bitwise AND

bc. expr1 & expr2


h4(#LogicalRelationsandShiftOperators). Logical Relations and Shift Operators

|<. less than|<. @<@|
|<. equal or less than|<. @<=@|
|<. greater than|<. @>@|
|<. equal or greater than|<. @>=@|
|<. equal|<. @==@|
|<. not equal|<. @!=@|
|<. shift left|<. @<<@|
|<. shift right|<. @>>@|

h4(#Binaryarithmeticoperators). Binary arithmetic operators

|<. plus|<. @+@|
|<. minus|<. @-@|
|<. multiply|<. @*@|
|<. divide|<. @/@|
|<. modulo|<. @%@|

h4(#Unaryarithmeticoperators). Unary arithmetic operators

|<. positive|<. @+@|
|<. negative|<. @-@|
|<. complement|<. @~@|

h3(#scopes). Scopes

==<!-- Start stext_keyword_namespace -->==

h4(#Namespace). Namespace

The language allows to define unique namespaces which can be used to qualify references to the statechart.

bc. namespace trafficlights

==<!-- End stext_keyword_namespace -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_interface -->==

h4(#interfacescope). Interface scope

Declarations in the interface scope are externally visible. They can be shared within the environment.

bc. interface NamedInterface:
in event event1
out event event3 : integer
var variable1 : integer

==<!-- End stext_keyword_interface -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_internal -->==

h4(#internal-scope). Internal scope

Declarations made in an internal scope are visible to contained states only.

bc. internal:
var localVariable1: integer
event localEvent: integer
local event localEvent2
operation localOperation (int1 : integer, int2 : integer): integer
localEvent2 / raise NamedInterface.event3 :
localOperation(valueof(localEvent) , NamedInterface.variable1)

==<!-- End stext_keyword_internal -->==


h3(#declarations). Declarations

Within scopes, variables, constants, events, variables, operations, and local reactions can be declared.


==<!-- Start stext_keyword_var -->==

h4(#variables). Variables

Variables can have different visibilities. They can be visible for the environment:

bc. var variable1: real


Variables can be _readonly_ (constants):

bc. var readonly pi: real = 3.1415


Variables can be referenced by the environment.

bc. var external variable3: integer = 34

==<!-- End stext_keyword_var -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_const -->==

h4(#constants). Constants

Variables can be immutable. For this special variable the keyword @const@ is used:

bc. const variable1: real

==<!-- End stext_keyword_const -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_event -->==

h4(#events). Events

h5(#incoming-and-outgoing-events). Incoming and outgoing events

An event in an interface scope has a direction. It is either ingoing or outgoing:

bc. interface NamedInterface:
in event event1
out event event2


h5(#events-with-variables). Events with variables

An event in the local scope can carry variables:

bc. internal:
event localEvent1 : integer


A local event can have a value assignment:

bc. internal:
event localEvent1: integer = 25


Read access to the value of an event is possible in the statechart using the @valueof()@ built-in method. Please note that reading an event's value is possible only when the event actually occurs, for example in a guard:

bc. localEvent1 [valueof(localEvent1) == 6]


An event parameter can be specified when raising an event, as in the following example:

bc. raise event1 : 3+3


p. 

###. FIXME: Explain how and where an event can be raised!

==<!-- End stext_keyword_event -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_operation -->==

h4(#operations). Operations

Operations can have none, one or multiple parameters. A parameter is declared with a name and a type. An operation may have a single return type similar to Java.

bc. operation localOperation (xValue : integer, yValue : integer):integer

==<!-- End stext_keyword_operation -->==


h4(#local-reactions). Local reactions

Local reactions describe the internal behavior of a state. So they have internal scope. A local reaction is declared as follows:

bc.. 
LocalReaction: ReactionTrigger '/' ReactionEffect ('#' ReactionProperties)?

ReactionTrigger: (Event ("," Event  )*  (=&gt; '[' Expression ']')?) | '[' Expression ']'

ReactionEffect:  Statement (';' Statement )* (';')?

Statement: Assignment | EventRaising | OperationCall

ReactionProperties: (EntryPoint | ExitPoint)*

p. Within a local reaction an interface event can be raised:

bc. internal:
localEvent1 / raise NamedInterface.event3 : localOperation (valueof(localEvent), NamedInterface.variable1);


A local reaction can have a priority value. The latter is defined by appending the character @#@ and the numeric priority value to the local reaction's definition. Examples:

###. FIXME: Describe the meaning of priorities!

bc. localEvent2 / NamedInterface.variable2 += 3; #1
localEvent3 / NamedInterface.variable4 += 2.0; #2


h3(#reaction-triggers). Reaction triggers

Actions are key constructs in state machines to model behavior. YAKINDU SCT knows about the following kinds of actions.


==<!-- Start stext_keyword_after -->==

h4(#after). after

The _after_ trigger specifies a one-shot time event.

After the specified time the reaction is triggered. An _after_ trigger can be used in transitions of states as well as in local reactions of states and statecharts. The specified time starts when the state or statechart is entered.

bc. after 20 s

Synopsis: @after@ _time_ _unit_


The _time_ value is a integer literal or an expression with an integer value.

The time _unit_ is one of:

* ==<!-- Start stext_keyword_s -->== @s@: seconds ==<!-- End stext_keyword_s -->==
* ==<!-- Start stext_keyword_ms -->==@ms@: milliseconds ==<!-- End stext_keyword_ms -->==
* ==<!-- Start stext_keyword_us -->==@us@: microseconds ==<!-- End stext_keyword_us -->==
* ==<!-- Start stext_keyword_ns -->==@ns@: nanoseconds ==<!-- End stext_keyword_ns -->==

==<!-- End stext_keyword_after -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_every -->==

h4(#every). every

The _every_ trigger specifies periodic time events.

The reaction is triggered recurrently after each passing of the specified period of time. An _every_ trigger can be used in transitions as well as in local reactions of states and statecharts. The specified period of time starts when the state or statechart is entered and repeats periodically.

bc. every 200 ms


Synopsis: @every@ _time_ _unit_

The _time_ value is a integer literal or an expression with an integer value.

The time _unit_ is one of:

* @s@: seconds
* @ms@: milliseconds
* @us@: microseconds
* @ns@: nanoseconds

==<!-- End stext_keyword_every -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_always -->==

h4(#always). always

This trigger is always true and enables a reaction to be executed in every run-to-completion step (RTC). The _always_ trigger is equivalent to the _oncycle_ trigger.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_always -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_oncycle -->==

h4(#oncycle). oncycle

This trigger is always true and enables a reaction to be executed in every run-to-completion step (RTC). The _always_ trigger is equivalent to the _oncycle_ trigger.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_oncycle -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_else -->==

h4(#else). else

This trigger is intended to be used for the outgoing transitions of _choice_ pseudo states to make sure that there is always an outgoing transition that can be taken. It can only be be used in transitions and implies the lowest evaluation priority for that transition. The _default_ trigger is equivalent to the _else_ trigger.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_else -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_default -->==

h4(#default). default

This trigger is intended to be used for the outgoing transitions of _choice_ pseudo states to make sure that there is always an outgoing transition that can be taken. It can only be be used in transitions and implies the lowest evaluation priority for that transition. The _default_ trigger is equivalent to the _else_ trigger.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_default -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_entry -->==

h4(#entry-1). entry

An _entry_ trigger marks actions that are carried out when entering a state or state machine.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_entry -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_exit -->==

h4(#exit-1). exit

An _exit_ trigger marks actions that are carried out when exiting a state or state machine.

==<!-- End stext_keyword_exit -->==


h3(#built-in-functions). Built-in functions

==<!-- Start stext_keyword_valueof -->==

h4(#valueofevent). valueof(event)

An event can have a value. This function returns the value of the specified event.

###. FIXME: Specify what happens if the event does not have a value.

bc. myVar = valueof(myEvent)

==<!-- End stext_keyword_valueof -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_as -->==

h4(#as). as

Casts a variable. The following example casts a literal from integer to real.

bc. myReal = 12 as real

==<!-- End stext_keyword_as -->==
==<!-- Start stext_keyword_active -->==

h4(#activestate). active(state)

Returns _true_ if the specified state is active and _false_ otherwise.

bc. myBool = active(StateA)

==<!-- End stext_keyword_ -->==

h3(#using-subdiagrams). Using subdiagrams

When using composite states, a statechart model often becomes too big to give a comprehensive overview of the whole diagram. Although it is possible to collapse and expand a state's figure compartment, these actions would spoil the diagram layout each time they are executed. Subdiagrams come as a solution.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/extract_subdiagram.png(Composite state)!

p=. Composite state

When the _Extract Subdiagram_ refactoring is executed on a composite state, all containing regions are extracted into a separate diagram. A small decorator in the lower-right corner of the state indicates the existence of such a subdiagram. When you hover with the mouse cursor over this decorator, you'll see a small preview of the subdiagram's content. The refactoring also creates the required _entry_ and _exit_ points for you.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/extract_subdiagram2.png(Subdiagram popup window)!

h3(#exporting-a-statechart-as-an-image-file). Exporting a statechart as an image file

A statechart can be saved as an image file and e. g. be included in some documentation. The following steps explain how to do the export.

In the statechart editor, right-click on the main region. The context menu appears.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/exporting_statechart_as_image_010_save_as_menu_item.png(Selecting the "Save As Image File..." menu item)!

p=. Selecting the "Save As Image File..." menu item

In the context menu, select File → Save As Image File.... The _Save As Image_ dialog appears.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/exporting_statechart_as_image_020_save_as_dialog.png(The "Save As Image File" dialog)!

p=. The "Save As Image File" dialog

Specify the filesystem folder for the exported image file in the _Folder_ text field.

Enter the name of the export image file into the _File Name_ text field. The file name extension depends on the selected image format (see below).

Select the image format from the _Image Format_ drop-down menu. YAKINDU Statechart Tools supports the following formats:

<dl>
<dt>BMP, GIF, PNG</dt>
<dd><p>Lossless pixel image formats</p></dd>
<dt>JPG, JPEG</dt>
<dd><p>Lossy pixel image format. Both JPG and JPEG essentially stand for the same image format. You can specify the image quality via the _Quality (%)_ setting.</p></dd>
<dt>SVG</dt>
<dd><p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</p></dd>
<dt>PDF</dt>
<dd><p>Portable Document Format (PDF)</p></dd>
</dl>

Selecting an image format changes the export file name's extension appropriately, e. g. if the file name you entered was @foobar@, and the you select PNG as image format, the file name will change to @foobar.png@.

bq.. *Note*

The image export functionality is subject to the capabilities of your Java runtime environment (JRE). You can export images only in those image formats your JRE actually supports.

p. The _Quality (%)_ text field is active for JPEG images only. JPEG is a lossy format, and reducing the quality results in a smaller file size. However, due to the nature of statechart images, a lossless format like PNG is most often a better choice, both in quality and in file size.

Check _Overwrite existing file without warning_ if you don't want to be bothered by a confirmation dialog which will appear if the export file already exists.

Check _Export to HTML_ to create both the image file plus an HTML file to include it.

All generators can be customized by a generator model. This is a textual model in a file, specifying generator features, i. e. the outlet path. The following screenshot shows a sample configuration for the Java code generator.

To get started with the generator model, YAKINDU Statechart Tools includes a wizard that creates a basic configuration file with default values.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/sGenEditor.png(SGen generator model with default values)!

p=. SGen generator model with default values

###. FIXME: Explain what a "builder" is!

The generator model is associated with a builder. If _Project → Build Automatically_ is checked, the generator automatically creates its output files for each modification the user makes to the statechart model. The sections below explain the specific customizing features of the generator models.

The following section describes the *Core Features* which are available for all code generators.


==<!-- Start sgen_feature_outlet -->==

h4(#outlet). Outlet

The *Outlet* feature specifies target project and target folder for the generated artifacts. It is a _required_ feature and has the following parameters:

# _targetProject_ (String, required): The project to store the generated artifacts to.
# _targetFolder_ (String, required): The folder to store the generated artifacts to. If a library folder is given, only the dynamic (i. e. model-dependent artifacts) are generated into the target folder, if not all generated artifacts will be generated into it. All artifacts in this folder will be overwritten during re-generation.
# _libraryTargetFolder_ (String, optional): The folder to store the static (i. e. model-independent artifacts) to. In case this is not specified, all artifacts will be generated into the target folder. All artifacts in this folder will be preserved during re-generation.

bq.. *Example:*

bc. feature Outlet {
    targetProject = "SampleProject"
    targetFolder = "src-gen"
    libraryTargetFolder = "src"
}

==<!-- End sgen_feature_outlet -->==
==<!-- Start sgen_feature_licenseheader -->==

h4(#LicenseHeader). LicenseHeader

The *LicenseHeader* feature specifies the license text to be added as a header to the generated artifacts. It is an *optional* feature and has the following parameter:

# _licenseText_ (String, required): License text to be added as a file header

bq.. *Example:*

bc. feature LicenseHeader {
    licenseText = "Copyright (c) 2016 committers of YAKINDU and others."
}

==<!-- End sgen_feature_licenseheader -->==
==<!-- Start sgen_feature_functioninlining -->==

h4(#FunctionInlining). FunctionInlining

The *FunctionInlining* feature enables the inlining of expressions instead of generating separate functions or methods. This might reduce the readability of the generated code, but increases performance, because less operation calls are necessary. This is an *optional* feature and has the following parameters:

# _inlineReactions_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for reactions
# _inlineEntryActions_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for entry actions
# _inlineExitActions_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for exit actions
# _inlineEnterSequences_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for enter sequences
# _inlineExitSequences_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for exit sequences
# _inlineChoices_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for choices
# _inlineEnterRegion_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for enter regions
# _inlineExitRegion_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for exit regions
# _inlineEntries_ (Boolean, optional): inlines the expression for entries

bq.. *Example:*

bc. feature FunctionInlining {
    inlineChoices = false
    inlineEnterRegion = true
    inlineEntries = true
}

==<!-- End sgen_feature_functioninlining -->==
==<!-- Start sgen_feature_debug -->==

h4(#Debug). Debug

The *Debug* feature dumps the execution model to the target folder as an XMI model. It is an *optional* feature and has the following parameter:

# _dumpSexec_ (Boolean, required): dumps the execution model as XMI model

bq.. *Example:*

bc. feature Debug {
    dumpSexec = true
}

==<!-- End sgen_feature_debug -->==

h3(#c-generator-features). C generator features

The C generator features are the same a the "C&#43;&#43; generator features":#cpp-generator-features.

h3(#specifications-of-c-code). Specification of C code

The explanations below are using the _TrafficLight_ sample state machine to describe the API specifications of the code generated by the YAKINDU C and Java code generators. The image below is showing the statechart. It models a pedestrian crossing with push-button operated traffic lights ("pelican crossing").

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/TrafficLight.png(The traffic light model)!

p=. The traffic light model

You can checkout the C sample project "org.yakindu.sct.examples.c.trafficlight":https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts/tree/master/examples/org.yakindu.sct.examples.c.trafficlight_ from the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools GitHub repository":https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts. The C example contains statechart, SGen model, graphical widgets, and some glue code to connect the generated code with the widgets. The graphical widgets are based on Qt.

To execute the C example, run the file _org&#95;yakindu&#95;sct&#95;examples&#95;c&#95;trafficlight&#95;_ as _Local C/C&#43;&#43; application_ from the Eclipse _Run As_ context menu.

h4(#c-generated-code). Generated code files

You will find the generated code in the _src-gen_ folder of the traffic light example.

The C code generator generates three header files. The first one is _sc&#95;types.h_:

bc.. 

#ifndef SC_TYPES_H_
#define SC_TYPES_H_

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif 

#include <stdint.h>

#endif

#define bool_true true
#define bool_false false

#endif /* SC_TYPES_H_ */

p. The header file contains some basic definitions for C&#43;&#43; compiler compatibility and typedefs to map the YAKINDU statechart types to C types. The next header file is named after the statechart. In case of the traffic light example it is called _TrafficLightWaiting.h_:

#endif /* TRAFFICLIGHTWAITING_H_ */

p. Within this header file an @enum@ containing the state names is defined as well as data structures for each of the statechart's interfaces. Additionally a structure for the statechart's time events is defined. The interfaces' and time events' data structures are nested into the parent structure @TrafficLightWaiting@. The client has to allocate this structure. It is a common parameter of most methods the statechart defines. Below this structure is called the _statechart data structure_.

h5(#c-fundamental-statechart-methods). Fundamental statechart methods

The generated code contains fundamental methods to initialize, enter, and exit a state machine, as well as a method to start a run-to-completion step.

In the header file the method names are made up of the statechart name followed by the name of the respective functionality. For example, the methods of the traffic light example are generated as follows:

bc. 
extern void trafficLightWaiting_init(TrafficLightWaiting* handle);
extern void trafficLightWaiting_enter(TrafficLightWaiting* handle);
extern void trafficLightWaiting_exit(TrafficLightWaiting* handle);
extern void trafficLightWaiting_runCycle(TrafficLightWaiting* handle);

<ul><li><p>The @init()@ method is used to initialize the statechart data structure right after its instantiation. Variables are initialized to their respective default values. If the statechart defines initialized variables, these initializations are also done in the @init()@ method.</p></li><li><p>The @enter()@ method must be called to enter the state machine. It brings the state machine to a well-defined state.</p></li><li><p>The @exit()@ method is used to leave a state machine statefully. If for example a history state is used in one of the top regions, the last active state is stored and the state machine is left via @exit()@. Re-entering it via @enter()@ continues to work with the saved state.</p></li><li><p>The @runCycle()@ method is used to trigger a run-to-completion step in which the state machine evaluates arising events and computes possible state changes. Somewhat simplified, a run-to-completion cycle consists of the following steps:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Clear list of outgoing events.</p></li><li><p>Check whether events have occurred which are leading to a state change.</p></li><li><p>If a state change has to be done:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Execute exit actions of the present state.</p></li><li><p>Save history state, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Make the new state active.</p></li><li><p>Execute entry actions of the new state.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Clear list of incoming events.</p></li></ol></li></ul>

h5(#accessing-variables-and-events). Accessing variables and events

The getters and setters for each variable and event are also contained in the header file. The method names are matching the following pattern:

_statechart_name_ @Iface@ _interface_name_@_@ [ @set@ | @get@ | @raise@ ] @_@ [_variable_name_|_event_name_]


For example, the getter of the @red@ variable of the @Pedestrian@ interface is named @trafficLightWaitingIfacePedestrian_get_red(TrafficLightWaiting* handle)@

h4(#time-controlled-state-machines). Time-controlled state machines

If a statechart uses timing functionality or external operations, an additional header file is generated. Its name matches the following pattern:

_statechart_name_@Required.h@

This header file defines method hooks the client code has to implement externally.

The traffic light example uses timing funtionality, namely _after_ clauses. To support time-controlled behavior, the additional header file _TrafficLightWaitingRequired.h_ is generated.

bc.. 

#ifndef TRAFFICLIGHTWAITINGREQUIRED_H_

*/
extern void trafficLightWaiting_unsetTimer(TrafficLightWaiting* handle, const sc_eventid evid);



#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif 

#endif /* TRAFFICLIGHTWAITINGREQUIRED_H_ */

p. Basically the proper time handling has to be implemented by the developer, because timer functions generally depend on the hardware target used. So for each hardware target the client code must provide a method to set a timer and another method to unset it. These methods have to be implemented externally and linked to the generated code.

The following methods are dealing with timing functionality:

h5(#c-settimer). Method setTimer

A state machine calls the @setTimer()@ method – short for the method's full name like e. g. @void trafficLightWaiting_setTimer(TrafficLightWaiting* handle, const sc_eventid evid, const sc_integer time_ms, const sc_boolean periodic)@ – to tell the timer service that it has to start a timer for the given time event identifier and raise it after the period of time specified by the _time&#95;ms_ parameter has expired. It is important to only start a timer thread or a hardware timer interrupt within the @setTimer()@ method and avoid any time-consuming operations like extensive computations, sleeping or waiting. Never call the statechart API functions from within these functions! Otherwise the state machine execution might hang within the timer service or might not show the expected runtime behavior.

In order to have the timer service raise the time event periodically, the parameter _periodic_ must be _true_.

h5(#method-unsettimer). Method unsetTimer

The state machine calls the method @trafficLightWaiting_setTimer(TrafficLightWaiting* handle, const sc_eventid evid, const sc_integer time_ms, const sc_boolean periodic)@ to notify the timer service to unset the timer for the given event ID.

h5(#method-raisetimeevent). Method raiseTimeEvent

In order to notify the state machine about the occurence of a time event after a period of time has expired, the @raiseTimeEvent()@ method – defined in the header file of the state machine – is called on the state machine. In the case of the traffic light example it is named @trafficLightWaiting_raiseTimeEvent(const TrafficLightWaiting* handle, sc_eventid evid)@ (in file _TrafficLightWaiting.h_).

The time event is recognized by the state machine and will be processed during the next run cycle.

You can conclude that in order to process the time events raised by the timing service without too much latency, the runtime environment has to call the state machine's @runCycle()@ method as frequently as needed. Consider for example a time event which is raised by the timer service after 500 ms. However, if the runtime environment calls the state machine's @runCycle()@ method with a frequency of once per 1000 ms only, the event will quite likely not be processed at the correct points in time.

h4(#c-operation-callbacks). Operation callbacks

YAKINDU Statechart Tools support client code operations that can be used by a state machine and are executed as as actions. These operations have to be implemented in order to make a statechart executable. The figure below shows a sample statechart using an operation:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/operationExample.png(Specifying an operation callback in the model)!

p=. Specifying an operation callback in the model

Let's have a look at the generated code:

There are some constraints that have to be considered for the implementation of these functions:
	- never call the statechart API functions from within these functions.

*/
extern sc_integer defaultSMIfaceSample_myOperation(DefaultSM* handle, const sc_integer p1, const sc_boolean p2);




#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif 

#endif /* DEFAULTSMREQUIRED_H_ */

p. An additional method @sc_integer defaultSMIfaceSample_myOperation(DefaultSM* handle, const sc_integer p1, const sc_boolean p2)@ has been generated. This method has to be implemented and linked with the generated code, so that the state machine can use it.

h4(#c-integrating-generated-code). Integrating generated code

To get a clue how to integrate a generated C state machines with your project have a look at the @main.c@ file and its @main()@ method:

bc.. 
#include "org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight.h"

#include
#include
#include "src-gen/sc_types.h"
#include "src-gen/TrafficLightWaiting.h"
#include "statemachine/TrafficLightTimer.h"
#include "statemachine/TrafficLightRunner.h"

TrafficLightTimer *timer;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    TrafficLightWaiting handle;
    trafficLightWaiting_init(&amp;handle);
    timer = new TrafficLightTimer(&amp;handle);
    trafficLightWaiting_enter(&amp;handle);
    QApplication a(argc, argv);
    TrafficLightRunner *runner = new TrafficLightRunner(&amp;handle, 100);
    org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight w(0, runner);
    w.show();
    int ret = a.exec();
    return ret;
}

void trafficLightWaiting_setTimer(const sc_eventid evid,
        const sc_integer time_ms, const sc_boolean periodic) {
    timer-&gt;setTimer(evid, time_ms, periodic);
}

void trafficLightWaiting_unsetTimer(const sc_eventid evid) {
    timer-&gt;unsetTimer(evid);
}

p. First an instance of the statechart data structure is created and initialized by the @trafficLightWaiting_init(&handle)@ method. The next step instantiates the timer. The class @TrafficLightTimer@ represents an implementation of a timer service and uses the timer functionality of the Qt framework. The @TrafficLightRunner@ is a runtime service which executes a run-to-completion step of the state machine every 100 ms. The runner class and the GUI are wired in the class @org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight@:

bc.. 
#include "org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight.h"

org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight::org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight(

    pedestrianLight = new PedestrianLightWidget(crossing);
    pedestrianLight-&gt;setGeometry(50, 10, 70, 20);

h4(#tracing). Tracing

The *Tracing* feature enables the generation of tracing callback functions:

* _enterState_ (boolean, optional): specifies whether to generate a callback function that is used to notify about state entering events
* _exitState_ (boolean, optional): specifies whether to generate a callback that is used to notify about state exiting events.

h4(#generatoroptions). GeneratorOptions

The *GeneratorOptions* feature allows to change the behavior of the C&#43;&#43; generator:

# _innerFunctionVisibility_ (String, optional): This parameter is used to change the visibility of inner functions and variables. By default @private@ visibility is used. It can be changed to @protected@ to allow function overriding for a class which inherits from the generated state machine base class.
# _staticOperationCallback_ (Boolean, optional): If this parameter is set to _true_, the callback function declaration for statechart operations is static and the functions are called statically by the state machine code.

bq.. *Example:*

bc. feature GeneratorOptions {
    innerFunctionVisibility =  "protected"
    staticOperationCallback = true
}

h3(#cpp-code-specification). Specification of C++ code

The explanations below are using the _TrafficLight_ sample state machine to describe the API specifications of the code generated by the YAKINDU C and Java code generators. The image below is showing the statechart. It models a pedestrian crossing with push-button operated traffic lights ("pelican crossing").

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/TrafficLight.png(The traffic light model)!

p=. The traffic light model

You can checkout the C&#43;&#43; sample project "QtTrafficLightCpp":http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/yakindu/SCT2/trunk/examples from the "YAKINDU Google Code repository":http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/yakindu/SCT2/trunk. The C&#43;&#43; example contains statechart, SGen model, graphical widgets, and some glue code to connect the generated code with the widgets. The graphical widgets are based on Qt.

###. FIXME: C: To execute the C example, run the file &#95;org&#95;yakindu&#95;sct&#95;examples&#95;c&#95;trafficlight&#95; as "Local C/C\&#43;\&#43; application" from the Eclipse &#95;Run As&#95; context menu.

h4(#cpp-generated-code). Generated code files

You will find the generated code in the _src-gen_ folder of the traffic light example.

The _StatemachineInterface.h_ header file defines the fundamental state machine interface methods. This file also contains the definition of the abstract class @StatemachineInterface@ which contains pure virtual functions only. It is needed by each particular state machine and is independend from concrete ones.

h4(#cpp-statemachine-class). Statemachine class

The state machine source code is generated as a C&#43;&#43; class with the same name as the statechart. For example, if the statechart is named _DefaultSM_ the C&#43;&#43; class will also be called _DefaultSM_ and will be generated as the source code file _DefaultSM.cpp_.

h4(#cpp-abstract-class-statemachineinterface). Abstract class StatemachineInterface

Each generated state machine implements the interface @StatemachineInterface@:

bc.. 
#ifndef STATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_
#define STATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_

/*

 */
class StatemachineInterface

	 	*/
		virtual sc_boolean isFinal() = 0;
};

inline StatemachineInterface::~StatemachineInterface() {}

#endif /* STATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_ */

h5(#cpp-fundamental-statechart-methods). Fundamental statechart methods

The generated code contains fundamental methods to initialize, enter, and exit a state machine, as well as a method to start a run-to-completion step.

The @StatemachineInterface@ interface specifies the four functions @init()@, @enter()@, @exit()@ and @runCycle()@.

<ul><li><p>The @init()@ function is used to initialize the internal objects of the state machine right after its instantiation. Variables are initialized to their respective default values. If the statechart defines initialized variables, these initializations are also done in the @init()@ function.</p></li><li><p>The @enter()@ function must be called to enter the state machine. It brings the state machine to a well-defined state.</p></li><li><p>The @exit()@ function is used to leave a state machine statefully. If for example a history state is used in one of the top regions, the last active state is stored and the state machine is left via @exit()@. Re-entering it via @enter()@ continues to work with the saved state.</p></li><li><p>The @runCycle()@ function is used to trigger a run-to-completion step in which the state machine evaluates arising events and computes possible state changes. Somewhat simplified, a run-to-completion cycle consists of the following steps:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Clear list of outgoing events.</p></li><li><p>Check whether events have occurred which are leading to a state change.</p></li><li><p>If a state change has to be done:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Execute exit actions of the present state.</p></li><li><p>Save history state, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Make the new state active.</p></li><li><p>Execute entry actions of the new state.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Clear list of incoming events.</p></li></ol></li></ul>

h4(#cpp-time-controlled-state-machines). Time-controlled state machines

If a statechart uses timing functionality, additional classes are generated.

The traffic light example uses timing funtionality, namely _after_ clauses. To support time-controlled behavior, the abstract classes @TimedStatemachineInterface@ and @TimerInterface@ are generated.

The @TimedStatemachineInterface@ interface extends the generated state machine by a @TimerInterface@ data member. The client code must provide an implementation of that interface.

@TimedStatemachineInterface@ also specifies the callback function @raiseTimeEvent(sc_eventid event)@, enabling the timer service to raise time events.

bc.. 

#ifndef TIMEDSTATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_
#define TIMEDSTATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_

#include "sc_types.h"
#include "TimerInterface.h"

/*
* Interface for state machines which use timed event triggers.
*/
class TimedStatemachineInterface {
	public:
	
		virtual ~TimedStatemachineInterface() = 0;
		
		/*
		* Set the ITimerService for the state machine. It must be set
		* externally on a timed state machine before a run cycle can be correct
		* executed.
		*/
		virtual void setTimer(TimerInterface* timer) = 0;
		
		/*
		* Returns the currently used timer service.
		*/
		virtual TimerInterface* getTimer() = 0;
		
		/*
		* Callback method if a time event occurred.
		*/
		virtual void raiseTimeEvent(sc_eventid event) = 0;
};

inline TimedStatemachineInterface::~TimedStatemachineInterface() {}

#endif /* TIMEDSTATEMACHINEINTERFACE_H_ */

p. Basically the proper time handling has to be implemented by the developer, because timer functions generally depend on the hardware target used. So for each hardware target a timer service class implementing the @TimerInterface@ interface has to be developed.

Let's have a look at the @TimerInterface@ interface:

bc.. 
#ifndef TIMERINTERFACE_H_
#define TIMERINTERFACE_H_

#include "sc_types.h"

//forward declaration of TimedStatemachineInterface to avoid cyclic dependency
class TimedStatemachineInterface;

/*
 * Basic interface for state machines.
 */
class TimerInterface
{
	public:
		
		virtual ~TimerInterface() = 0;
	
		/*
		 * Starts the timing for a time event.
		 */ 
		virtual void setTimer(TimedStatemachineInterface* statemachine, sc_eventid event, sc_integer time, sc_boolean isPeriodic) = 0;
		
		/*
		 * Unsets the given time event.
		 */
		virtual void unsetTimer(TimedStatemachineInterface* statemachine, sc_eventid event) = 0;
	
		/*
		 * Cancel timer service. Use this to end possible timing threads and free
		 * memory resources.
		 */
		virtual void cancel() = 0;
};

inline TimerInterface::~TimerInterface() {}

#endif /* TIMERINTERFACE_H_ */

p. The @TimerInterface@ interface defines the following functions dealing with timing functionality:

h5(#cpp-settimer). Function setTimer

A state machine calls the @setTimer(TimedStatemachineInterface* statemachine, sc_eventid event, sc_integer time, sc_boolean isPeriodic)@ function to tell the timer service that it has to start a timer for the given time event and raise it after the period of time specified by the _time_ parameter has expired. It is important to only start a timer thread or a hardware timer interrupt within the @setTimer()@ function and to avoid any time-consuming operations like extensive computations, @Thread.sleep(…)@ or waiting. Otherwise the state machine execution might hang within the timer service or might not show the expected runtime behavior.

In order to have the timer service raise the time event periodically, the parameter _isPeriodic_ must be _true_.

h5(#cpp-unsettimer). Function unsetTimer

The state machine calls the function @unsetTimer(TimedStatemachineInterface* statemachine, sc_eventid event)@ to notify the timer service to unset the timer for the given event ID.

h5(#cpp-raisetimeevent). Function raiseTimeEvent

In order to notify the state machine about the occurence of a time event after a period of time has expired, the function @raiseTimeEvent(sc_eventid event)@ must be called on the state machine. For this purpose, the state machine must implement the @TimedStatemachineInterface@) interface.

The time event is recognized by the state machine and will be processed during the next run cycle.

You can conclude that in order to process the time events raised by the timing service without too much latency, the runtime environment has to call the state machine's @runCycle()@ function as frequently as needed. Consider for example a time event which is raised by the timer service after 500 ms. However, if the runtime environment calls the state machine's @runCycle()@ function with a frequency of once per 1000 ms only, the event will quite likely not be processed at the correct points in time.

h4(#cpp-accessing). Accessing interfaces, variables and events

In a YAKINDU statechart, variables and events are contained in so-called _interfaces_. There can be at most one default, unnamed interface plus zero or more named interfaces. In the generated C&#43;&#43; code, these interfaces can be found as internal subclasses of the main state machine class. This outer class' name is derived from the statechart's name while the internal subclasses' names are derived from the respective names of the statechart interfaces.

Let's have a look at the following sample statechart interface declaration of a statechart named _DefaultSM_:

bc. interface Sample:
    var a:boolean
    in event evA:boolean
    out event evB:integer

The generated interface code is shown below in the inner class _SCI_Sample_. Since the statechart's name is _DefaultSM_ the state machine class' name is also _DefaultSM_, to be found in the _DefaultSM.h_ file:

bc.. 

#ifndef DEFAULTSM_H_
#define DEFAULTSM_H_

#include "sc_types.h"
#include "StatemachineInterface.h"

/*! \file Header of the state machine 'DefaultSM'.

		sc_boolean isActive();
		
		
		/*!
		* Checks if all active states are final. 
		* If there are no active states then the state machine is considered being inactive. In this case this method returns false.
		*/
		sc_boolean isFinal();
		
		
		/*! Checks if the specified state is active (until 2.4.1 the used method for states was calles isActive()). */
		sc_boolean isStateActive(DefaultSMStates state);
	
	private:
	
	
		//! the maximum number of orthogonal states defines the dimension of the state configuration vector.
		static const sc_integer maxOrthogonalStates = 1;

};
#endif /* DEFAULTSM_H_ */

p. A statechart interface is generated as an internal subclass within the state machine class. The subclass' name is derived from the statechart interface's name by prepending the string @SCI_@.

A special case is the unnamed statechart interface: It is generated as the C++ subclass @SCInterface@.

An incoming event _evA:boolean_ is generated as the raise function @raise_evA(boolean value)@. Since the event is of type _boolean_ the function has a _boolean_ parameter.

For an outgoing event _evB:integer_ the functions @isRaised_evB()@ and @get_evB_value()@ are generated. The former can be used to determine whether the event has already been raised by the state machine or not. The latter serves to query the value of the event.

For variables, the code generator creates getter and setter functions, here @sc_boolean get_a()@ and @void set_a(sc_boolean value)@.

The code generator also creates appropriately named getter functions in the enclosing class which can be used to acquire the inner classes, here: @SCI_Sample* getSCI_Sample()@.

The nesting class is the generated state machine source code. It holds instances of the nested interface class implementations and provides them via getter functions. Have a look at (some snippets of) the source code generated for the _Sample_ statechart interface in the source file _DefaultSM.cpp_:

bc.. 
void DefaultSM::SCI_Sample::raise_evA(sc_boolean value)
{
	evA_value = value;
	evA_raised = true;
}

sc_boolean DefaultSM::SCI_Sample::isRaised_evB()
{
	return evB_raised;
}

sc_integer DefaultSM::SCI_Sample::get_evB_value()
{
	return evB_value;
}


sc_boolean DefaultSM::SCI_Sample::get_a()
{
	return a;
}

void DefaultSM::SCI_Sample::set_a(sc_boolean value)
{
	a = value;
}

p. The value of an event can be accessed only if the event has been processed in a run-to-completion step. Otherwise the event could contain an illegal value.

###. FIXME: In Java we have a section "Interface observers". What about a C&#43;&#43; equivalent?

h4(#cpp-operation-callbacks). Operation callbacks

YAKINDU Statechart Tools support client code operations that can be used by a state machine and are executed as as actions. These operations have to be implemented in order to make a statechart executable. The figure below shows a sample statechart using an operation:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/operationExample.png(Specifying an operation callback in the model)!

p=. Specifying an operation callback in the model

Let's have a look at the additionally generated code for operation support in the _DefaultSM.h_ header file:

bc.. 
				//! Inner class for Sample interface scope operation callbacks.
				class SCI_Sample_OCB
				{
					public:
						virtual ~SCI_Sample_OCB() = 0;
						
						virtual sc_integer myOperation(sc_integer p1, sc_boolean p2) = 0;
				};
				
				/*! Set the working instance of the operation callback interface 'SCI_Sample_OCB'. */
				void setSCI_Sample_OCB(SCI_Sample_OCB* operationCallback);

p. An additional interface @SCI_Sample_OCB@ with the pure virtual function @sc_integer myOperation(sc_integer p1, sc_boolean p2)@ has been generated. This interface has to be implemented, and an instance of the implementing class has to be provided to the state machine via the @setSCI_Sample_OCB(SCI_Sample_OCB* operationCallback)@ function, so that the state machine can use it.

bc.. 
#include "DefaultSM.h"

sc_integer DefaultSM::SCI_Sample_OCB::myOperation(sc_integer p1, sc_boolean p2) {
    // Your operation code should be placed here;
    return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    DefaultSM *defaultSM = new DefaultSM();
    SCI_Sample_OCB *sci_Sample_OCB = new SCI_Sample_OCB();

    defaultSM->setSCI_Sample_OCB(sci_Sample_OCB);

    defaultSM->init();
    defaultSM->enter();
    defaultSM->runCycle();
}

h3(#java-code-specification). Specification of Java code

The explanations below are using the _TrafficLight_ sample state machine to describe the API specifications of the code generated by the YAKINDU C and Java code generators. The image below is showing the statechart. It models a pedestrian crossing with push-button operated traffic lights ("pelican crossing").

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/TrafficLight.png(The traffic light model)!

p=. The traffic light model

You can checkout the Java sample project _"org.yakindusct.examples.trafficlight":https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts/tree/master/examples/org.yakindu.sct.examples.trafficlight_ from the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools GitHub repository":https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts. The Java example contains statechart, SGen model, graphical widgets, and some glue code to connect the generated code with the widgets. The graphical widgets are based on SWT.

To execute the Java example, run the file _CrossingDemoCycleBased.java_ as "Java Application" from the Eclipse _Run As_ context menu.

h4(#java-generated-code). Generated code files

Generally you will find generated code at the places specified in the SGen model, see "section &quot;Outlet&quot;":#outlet for details.

In the case of the traffic light example, you will find the generated code in the _src-gen_ folder.

The package _org.yakindu.sct.examples.trafficlight.cyclebased_ contains the general state machine interfaces and classes. They are needed by each particular state machine and are independend from concrete ones.

h4(#the-state-machine-interface). The state machine interface

Each generated state machine implements the @IStatemachine@ interface:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr;

/**
 * Basic interface for state machines.
 */
public interface IStatemachine {

	/**
	 * Initializes the state machine. Used to initialize internal variables etc.
	 */
	public void init();

	/**
	 * Enters the state machine. Sets the state machine into a defined state.
	 */
	public void enter();

	/**

	public void exit();

	/**

	 */
	public boolean isFinal();

	/**
	* Start a run-to-completion cycle.
	*/
	public void runCycle();
}


h5(#java-fundamental-statechart-methods). Fundamental statechart methods

The generated code contains fundamental methods to initialize, enter, and exit a state machine, as well as a method to start a run-to-completion step.

The @IStatemachine@ interface specifies the four methods @init()@, @enter()@, @exit()@, and @runCycle()@.

<ul><li><p>The @init()@ method is used to initialize the internal objects of the state machine right after its instantiation. Variables are initialized to their respective default values. If the statechart defines initialized variables, these initializations are also done in the @init()@ method.</p></li><li><p>The @enter()@ method must be called to enter the state machine. It brings the state machine to a well-defined state.</p></li><li><p>The @exit()@ method is used to leave a state machine statefully. If for example a history state is used in one of the top regions, the last active state is stored and the state machine is left via @exit()@. Re-entering it via @enter()@ continues to work with the saved state.</p></li><li><p>The @runCycle()@ method is used to trigger a run-to-completion step in which the state machine evaluates arising events and computes possible state changes. Somewhat simplified, a run-to-completion cycle consists of the following steps:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Clear list of outgoing events.</p></li><li><p>Check whether events have occurred which are leading to a state change.</p></li><li><p>If a state change has to be done:</p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><p>Execute exit actions of the present state.</p></li><li><p>Save history state, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Make the new state active.</p></li><li><p>Execute entry actions of the new state.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>Clear list of incoming events.</p></li></ul>


h4(#java-time-controlled-state-machines). Time-controlled state machines

If a statechart uses timing functionality, additional classes are generated.

The traffic light example uses timing funtionality, namely _after_ clauses. To support time-controlled behavior, the interfaces @ITimerCallback@ and @ITimer@ are generated. Like @IStatemachine@, they are independend of any particular state machine and are generated in the _libraryTargetFolder_ directory, if specified. See "section &quot;Outlet&quot;":#outlet for details.

The generated state machine class implements the @ITimerCallback@ and has a property _timer_ of type @ITimer@. The client code must provide an @ITimer@ implementation to the state machine by calling the latter's @setTimer()@ method.

Here's an example showing how to create a new instance of the state machine (here: class @MyTimedStatemachine@), create a new instance of a timer (here: class @MyTimer@), set the latter on the former, and start the state machine by entering it:

bc. MyTimedStatemachine sm = new MyTimedStatemachine();
sm.setTimer(new MyTimer());
sm.enter(); // Enter the state machine


Timer functions generally depend on the hardware target used, therefore the proper time handling has to be implemented by the developer. In principle, for each hardware target a dedicated timer service class implementing the @ITimer@ interface has to be developed.

h4(#default-timer-implementation). Default timer implementation

However, upon request the Java code generator can create a default implementation of the @ITimer@ interface, and in many cases it will be sufficient. This implementation is based on @java.util.Timer@ and @java.util.TimerTask@ and should be compatible with the Oracle JVM or the OpenJDK JVM.

To generate the default timer service class, set the _TimerService_ feature in the SGen model to _true_. Example:

bc.. 
GeneratorModel for yakindu::java {

    statechart MyStateMachine {

        /* … */

        feature GeneralFeatures {
            TimerService = true
        }

    }
}

p. The generated class is named @TimerService@ and looks like this:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr;

import java.util.ArrayList;

h4(#timer-service). Timer service

A timer service must implement the @ITimer@ interface and must be able to maintain a number of time events and the timers associated with them. A time event is identified by a numeric ID.

If suitable, an application can use the default timer service class @TimerService@, see "section &quot;Default timer implementation&quot;":#default-timer-implementation for details.

The @ITimer@ interface looks like this:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr;

/**
 * Interface a timer has to implement. Use to implement your own timer
 * service.
 * 
 */
public interface ITimer {

	/**
	 * Starts the timing for a given time event id.
	 * 
	 * @param callback
	 * 			  : The target callback where the time event has to be raised.
	 * 
	 * @param eventID
	 *            : The eventID the timer should use if timed out.
	 *            
	 * @param time
	 *            : Time in milliseconds after the given time event should be
	 *            triggered
	 *            
	 * @param isPeriodic
	 * 			  : Set to true if the time event should be triggered periodically
	 */
	public void setTimer(ITimerCallback callback, int eventID, long time, boolean isPeriodic);

	/**
	 * Unset a time event.
	 * 
	 * @param callback
	 * 			: The target callback for which the time event has to be unset.
	 * 
	 * @param eventID
	 * 			: The time event id.
	 */
	public void unsetTimer(ITimerCallback callback, int eventID);
}


h5(#java-settimer). Method setTimer

A state machine calls the @setTimer(ITimerCallback callback, int eventID, long time, boolean isPeriodic)@ method to tell the timer service that it has to start a timer for the given _eventID_. The _time_ parameter specifies the number of milliseconds until the timer expires. When this period of time has elapsed, the timer service must raise the time event by calling the method @public void timeElapsed(int eventID)@ on the @ITimerCallback@ specified by the _callback_ parameter, i. e. usually the state machine.

It is important to keep the execution of the @setTimer()@ method short and use it only to start a timer thread, a hardware timer interrupt, or the like. Avoid any time-consuming operations like extensive computations, @Thread.sleep(…)@, waiting, etc. Otherwise the state machine execution might hang within the timer service or might not show the expected runtime behavior.

If the parameter _isPeriodic_ is _false_, the timer service raises the time event only once. If _isPeriodic_ is _true_, the timer service raises the time event every _time_ milliseconds.

h5(#java-unsettimer). Method unsetTimer

If the state machine calls the @unsetTimer(ITimerCallback callback, int eventID)@ method the timer service must unset the timer for the given _eventID_, i. e. the time event will not be raised.

h4(#raising-time-events-on-a-state-machine). Raising time events on a state machine

If a statechart is using time events, the generated Java state machine class not only implements the @IStatemachine@ interface, but it also implements the @ITimerCallback@ interface. @ITimerCallback@ is defined as follows. It specifies a single method: @public void timeElapsed(int eventID)@.

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr;

/**
* Interface for state machines which use timed event triggers.
*/
public interface ITimerCallback {
	
	/**
	* Callback method if a time event occurred.
	* 
	* @param eventID
	* 			:The id of the occurred event.
	*/
	public void timeElapsed(int eventID);
}


h5(#java-timeelapsed). Method timeElapsed

It is the timer service's responsibility to actually raise a time event on a state machine. To do so, the timer service calls the state machine's @timeElapsed()@ method and supplies the time event's _eventID_ as a parameter. The state machine recognizes the time event and will process it during the next run cycle.

You can conclude that in order to process time events without too much latency, the runtime environment has to call the state machine's @runCycle()@ method as frequently as needed. Consider for example a time event which is raised by the timer service after 500 ms. However, if the runtime environment calls the state machine's @runCycle()@ method with a frequency of once per 1000 ms only, the event will quite likely not be processed at the correct points in time.

h4(#RuntimeService). Runtime service

The @RuntimeService@ class maintains all state machines that are expected to execute run-to-completion steps periodically. A client application can retrieve the @RuntimeService@ singleton using @RuntimeService.getInstance()@. It can then pause, resume or cancel all state machines that are poised to run at a specified intervall.

h4(#JavaInterVar). Accessing interfaces, variables and events

In a YAKINDU statechart, variables and events are contained in so-called *interfaces*. There can be at most one default, unnamed interface plus zero or more named interfaces. In the generated Java code, these interfaces can be found as inner interface of the interface specifying the state machine. The outer interface's name is derived from the statechart's name while the inner interfaces' names are derived from the respective names of the statechart interfaces.

Let's have a look at the following sample statechart interface declaration:

bc. interface Sample:
    var a:boolean
    in event evA:boolean
    out event evB:integer


The generated interface code looks like this:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr.defaultsm;
import org.yakindu.scr.IStatemachine;

public interface IDefaultSMStatemachine extends IStatemachine {
	public interface SCISample {
		public void raiseEvA(boolean value);
		public boolean isRaisedEvB();
		public long getEvBValue();
		public boolean getA();
		public void setA(boolean value);

	}

	public SCISample getSCISample();

}

p. A statechart interface is generated as an inner Java interface within the state machine interface. The Java interface's name is derived from the statechart interface's name by prepending the string @SCI@.

A special case is the unnamed statechart interface: It is generated as the Java interface @SCInterface@.

An incoming event _evA:boolean_ is generated as the raise method @raiseEvA(boolean value)@. Since the event is of type _boolean_ the method has a _boolean_ parameter.

For an outgoing event _evB:integer_ the methods @boolean isRaisedEvB()@ and @long getEvBValue()@ are generated. The former can be used to determine whether the event has already been raised by the state machine or not. The latter serves to query the value of the event.

For variables, the code generator creates getter and setter methods, here @boolean getA()@ and @void setA(boolean value)@.

The code generator also creates appropriately named getter methods in the enclosing interface which can be used to acquire the nested interfaces, here: @SCISample getSCISample()@.

The nesting interface is implemented by the generated state machine source code. Each nested interface is implemented as an internal class of the state machine class. The latter holds instances of the nested interface implementations and provides them via getter methods. Have a look at the source code generated for the _Sample_ interface:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr.defaultsm;

public class DefaultSMStatemachine implements IDefaultSMStatemachine {

	protected class SCISampleImpl implements SCISample {

		private boolean evA;

		private boolean evAValue;

		public void raiseEvA(boolean value) {
			evA = true;
			evAValue = value;
		}

		protected boolean getEvAValue() {
			if (!evA)
				throw new IllegalStateException("Illegal event value access. Event EvA is not raised!");
			return evAValue;
		}

		}

			return evBValue;
		}

		private boolean a;

		public boolean getA() {
			return a;
		}

		public void setA(boolean value) {
			this.a = value;
		}

		protected void clearEvents() {
			evA = false;
		}

		protected void clearOutEvents() {
			evB = false;
		}
	}

	protected SCISampleImpl sCISample;

	private boolean initialized = false;

	public enum State {
		main_region_MyState, $NullState$
	};

	private final State[] stateVector = new State[1];

	private int nextStateIndex;

	public DefaultSMStatemachine() {

		sCISample = new SCISampleImpl();
	}

	public void init() {
		this.initialized = true;
		for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
			stateVector[i] = State.$NullState$;
		}

		clearEvents();
		clearOutEvents();

		sCISample.setA(false);
	}

	public void enter() {
		if (!initialized)
			throw new IllegalStateException(
					"The state machine needs to be initialized first by calling the init() function.");

		enterSequence_main_region_default();
	}

	public void exit() {
		exitSequence_main_region();
	}

	/**
	 * @see IStatemachine#isActive()
	 */
	public boolean isActive() {

		return stateVector[0] != State.$NullState$;
	}

	/** 
	* Always returns 'false' since this state machine can never become final.

	}

	/**

	protected void clearEvents() {
		sCISample.clearEvents();

	}

	/**

	*/
	protected void clearOutEvents() {
		sCISample.clearOutEvents();
	}

	/**

	*/
	public boolean isStateActive(State state) {
		switch (state) {
			case main_region_MyState :
				return stateVector[0] == State.main_region_MyState;

	}

	/* 'default' enter sequence for state MyState */

	private void exitSequence_main_region_MyState() {
		nextStateIndex = 0;
		stateVector[0] = State.$NullState$;
	}

	/* Default exit sequence for region main region */
	private void exitSequence_main_region() {
		switch (stateVector[0]) {
			case main_region_MyState :
				exitSequence_main_region_MyState();
				break;

			default :
				break;
		}
	}

	}

	/* Default react sequence for initial entry  */
	private void react_main_region__entry_Default() {

	}

	public void runCycle() {
		if (!initialized)
			throw new IllegalStateException(
					"The state machine needs to be initialized first by calling the init() function.");

		clearOutEvents();

		for (nextStateIndex = 0; nextStateIndex < stateVector.length; nextStateIndex++) {

			switch (stateVector[nextStateIndex]) {
				case main_region_MyState :
					react_main_region_MyState();
					break;
				default :
					// $NullState$
			}
		}

		clearEvents();
	}
}

p. The value of an event can be accessed only if the event has been processed in a run-to-completion step. Otherwise an @IllegalStateException@ will be thrown.


h4(#JavaInterfaceObservers). Interface observers

If the general feature _InterfaceObserverSupport_ is enabled in the SGen model, the generated interfaces will support the registration of observers.

Enabling the _InterfaceObserverSupport_ feature looks like this in the _.sgen_ file:

bc. feature GeneralFeatures {
    InterfaceObserverSupport = true
}

Now the generated code has additional features:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr.defaultsm;
import java.util.List;
import org.yakindu.scr.IStatemachine;

public interface IDefaultSMStatemachine extends IStatemachine {
	public interface SCISample {
		public void raiseEvA(boolean value);
		public boolean isRaisedEvB();
		public long getEvBValue();
		public boolean getA();
		public void setA(boolean value);
		public List<SCISampleListener> getListeners();

	}

	public interface SCISampleListener {
		public void onEvBRaised(long value);
	}

	public SCISample getSCISample();

}

p. An additional listener interface is generated, here @SCISampleListener@. It contains a callback method for each outgoing event. Here it is a single one: @void onEvBRaised(long value)@.

The client code has to provide an implementation of the listener interface. A listener method gets called by the state machine when it raises an outgoing event.

To register or unregister a listener, use the @getListeners()@ method of the nesting interface. This method returns a @java.util.List@ parameterized with the appropriate listener type. Initially this list is empty. Add or remove listeners as needed.

A callback method specified by the listener interface should complete its operations quickly, because otherwise the state machine execution might be delayed for too long, potentially leading to unexpected runtime behavior.

h4(#java-operation-callback). Operation callbacks

YAKINDU Statechart Tools support _operations_ that are executed by a state machine as actions, but are implemented by client-side code. The figure below shows a sample statechart using an operation:

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/operationExample.png(Specifying an operation callback in the model)!

p=. Specifying an operation callback in the model

Let's have a look at the generated code:

bc.. 
package org.yakindu.scr.defaultsm;
import java.util.List;
import org.yakindu.scr.IStatemachine;

public interface IDefaultSMStatemachine extends IStatemachine {
	public interface SCISample {
		public void raiseEvA(boolean value);
		public boolean isRaisedEvB();
		public long getEvBValue();
		public boolean getA();
		public void setA(boolean value);
		public List<SCISampleListener> getListeners();

		public void setSCISampleOperationCallback(SCISampleOperationCallback operationCallback);
	}

	public interface SCISampleListener {
		public void onEvBRaised(long value);
	}

	public interface SCISampleOperationCallback {
		public long myOperation(long p1, boolean p2);
	}

	public SCISample getSCISample();

}

p. An additional interface @SCISampleOperationCallback@ specifying the method @public long myOperation(long p1, boolean p2)@ has been generated. The client code has to

* provide an implementation of this interface and
* pass an instance of it to the state machine via the @setSCISampleOperationCallback(SCISampleOperationCallback operationCallback)@ method.

Here's some sample code that passes an implementation of the operation to a state machine, and then executes the latter:

bc.. 
public static void main(String[] args) {
    DefaultSMStatemachine statemachine = new DefaultSMStatemachine();

    SCISampleOperationCallback callback = new SCISampleOperationCallback() {

        @Override
        public long myOperation(long p1, boolean p2) {
            // Your operation code should be placed here;
            return 0;
        }
    };

    statemachine.getSCISample().setSCISampleOperationCallback(callback);

    statemachine.init();
    statemachine.enter();
    statemachine.runCycle();
}


h4(#JavaIntegratingGeneratedCode). Integrating generated code

To get a clue how to integrate a generated Java state machine with your project have a look at the @CrossingDemoCycleBased@ class and its abstract superclass @CrossingDemoBase@. The @main()@ method is in @CrossingDemoCycleBased@:

bc. 
public static void main(String[] args) {

    new CrossingDemoCycleBased().runTrafficLight();
}

A new instance of the class is created and the method @runTrafficLight()@ is called. This method can be found in the superclass:

bc. 
public void runTrafficLight() {

        setUpAndRunStatemachine();
        createUIContent();

        shell.open();
        while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
            // update traffic lights
            readStatemachineOutput();

            crossing.repaint();

            if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
                display.sleep();
            }
        }

        tearDownStatemachine();
}

This method sets up the state machine and creates the GUI content. In a while loop it reads the content of the state machine and repaints the GUI. If the user exits the GUI shell, the loop terminates and the state machine is torn down. The really interesting methods are setUpAndRunStatemachine(), readStatemachineOutput(), and tearDownStatemachine():

bc. 
protected void setUpAndRunStatemachine() {

    statemachine = new TrafficLightWaitingStatemachine();
    statemachine.setTimerService(new TimerService());
    statemachine.init();
    statemachine.enter();

    RuntimeService.getInstance().registerStatemachine(statemachine, 100);
}

First a new instance of the generated state machine is created. Since the traffic light statechart uses timing clauses, it is provided with a timer service, here with the default implementation of the @ITimerService@ interface. In the next steps the state machine is initialized and entered. After the @enter()@ method has been executed, the machine is in a defined state.

Finally the state machine is passed to the runtime service. This service executes the @runCycle()@ method of the state machine every 100 ms, that is the state machine executes a run-to-completion step every 100 ms.

bc. protected void readStatemachineOutput() {
    trafficLightFigure.setRed(statemachine.getSCITrafficLight()
            .getRed());
    trafficLightFigure.setYellow(statemachine.getSCITrafficLight()
            .getYellow());
    trafficLightFigure.setGreen(statemachine.getSCITrafficLight()
            .getGreen());
        pedestrianLightFigure.setWhite(statemachine.getSCIPedestrian()
            .getRequest());
    pedestrianLightFigure.setRed(statemachine.getSCIPedestrian()
            .getRed());
    pedestrianLightFigure.setGreen(statemachine.getSCIPedestrian()
            .getGreen());
}

The generated code contains getters and setters for each variable and event. So it's easy to read values from or write values to a state machine, raise events, or ask the state machine whether outgoing events have been raised during the last run-to-completion step. Within the @readStatemachineOutput()@ method, these methods are used to get the lights values from the state machine and set them to the UI elements. The methods @pedestrianRequestButtonClicked()@ and @onOffButtonClicked()@ raise some events.

Hint: When outgoing events are raised within the state machine, they remain active until the next run-to-completion step is started.

bc. @Override
protected void tearDownStatemachine() {
    // End TimerHandler and RuntimeService.
    statemachine.getTimerService().cancel();
    RuntimeService.getInstance().cancelTimer();
}

If the UI thread has been terminated by the user, the state machine will be shut down. It is necessary to explicitly end the timer service. Finally the runtime service is cancelled.


h2(#custom-code-generator). Custom code generator

h3(#CreatingCustomCodeGenerators). Creating custom code generators

YAKINDU Statechart Tools provide a rich feature set to support custom code generators out of the box. These code generators can be either written in Java, "Xtend":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/, or "Xpand":http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/?project=xpand.

h4(#WritingacustomcodegeneratorwithXtend2Java). Writing a custom code generator with Xtend2/Java

First, you have to create a new Xtend2 generator project. Click _File → New → Other... → YAKINDU → YAKINDU Xtend2/Java Generator Project_ to create a new Xtend2 generator project.

!{width:80.0%;height:auto;}images/xtendGenerator.png(Creating an Xtend2 generator project)!

p=. Creating an Xtend2 generator project

The wizard asks for a *Project name* and the name of the *Generator class*, which has to be the fully-qualified class name. If you check the *Use Xtend* checkbox, the generator class will initially be created as an "Xtend":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ class. Otherwise, Java will be used for the generator.

The check box *Configure for Plugin Export* adds all required extension point registrations to the new project for exporting it as a plugin. The generator model can refer to the new generator plugin via its unique *Generator ID*. If you want to contribute custom generator features for your code generator, check the *Create Feature Library* check box.

After clicking on *Finish* a new project is created in your workspace. All required plugin dependencies and extension points are registered and you can start to write your code generator based on the ExecutionFlow meta model [Link].
